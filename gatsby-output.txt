Chapter 1 In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
 He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone.
 I had a dog, at least I had a dog for a few days until a dog ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.
 And as I walked on I was lonely no longer.
 I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler.
 He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
  And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.
 I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew.
 And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.
  I lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them.
 Or rather, as I didn't know Mr.
  Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans.
  And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.
  He had changed since his New Haven years.
  "Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final,"  he seemed to say, "just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are."  We were in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.
  "I've got a nice place here,"  he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.
 I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.
 If   saw me out of the corner of   eyes   gave no hint of it--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed   by coming in.
  "I'm p-paralyzed with happiness."
 (I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean toward daisy; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.
)  At any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, baker nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped baker head back again--the object baker was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given baker something of a fright.
  I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice.
  I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent a dozen people love through me.
  "Do they miss me?"  she cried ecstatically.
  "I'd like to."
  "I'm a bond man."
  "Who with?"
  I told him.
  "You will,"  I answered shortly.
 "You will if you stay in the East."
  "Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry,"  he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.
 "I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else."
  "I'm stiff,"  she complained, "I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember."
 "I've been trying to get you to New York all afternoon."
  "You are!"  He took down his drink as if his drink were a drop in the bottom of a glass.
 "How you ever get anything done is beyond me."
  I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was baker "got done."  I enjoyed looking at baker.
 It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.
 "I know somebody there."
  "I don't know a single----"
  "You must know Gatsby."
  "Gatsby?"  demanded Daisy.
 "What Gatsby?"
 "In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year."  She looked at us all radiantly.
 "Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it."
 "I know you didn't mean to but you did do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great big hulking physical specimen of a----"
 They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained.
 They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away.
  "You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,"  I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret.
  I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way.
  "Civilization's going to pieces,"  broke out Tom violently.
 "I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?"
  "Why, no,"  I answered, rather surprised by his tone.
  "Well, these books are all scientific,"  insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently.
  "We've got to beat them down,"  whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.
  "You ought to live in California--"  began Miss Baker but Tom interrupted miss baker by shifting heavily in tom chair.
 When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.
  "I'll tell you a family secret,"  a family secret whispered enthusiastically.
  "That's why I came over tonight."
  "Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish a silver service from morning till night until finally a silver service began to affect his nose----"
  "Things went from bad to worse,"  suggested Miss Baker.
  "Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position."
  For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.
  "I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn't he?"  She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.
 "An absolute rose?"
 I am not even faintly like a rose.
  Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning.
 I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said "Sh!"  in a warning voice.
 A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear.
 The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.
  "This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----"  I said.
  "You mean to say you don't know?"  said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.
 "I thought everybody knew."
  "I don't."
  Miss Baker nodded.
  Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.
  "It couldn't be helped!"  cried Daisy with tense gayety.
  She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued: "I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----"  her voice sang "----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?"
  "Very romantic,"  he said, and then miserably to me: "If it's light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables."
  The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook daisy head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air.
 Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes.
 I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind.
 Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front.
  Daisy took   daisy face in   daisy hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and   daisy eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk.
 I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.
  "I wasn't back from the war."
 "Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical about everything."
 I waited but she didn't say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.
  "Oh, yes."  She looked at me absently.
 "Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when nick was born. Would you like to hear?"
  "It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if the ether was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."
  "You see I think everything's terrible anyhow,"  she went on in a convinced way.
 "Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!"
  The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.
 It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me.
 I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.
 Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and miss baker read aloud to him from the "Saturday Evening Post" --the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune.
  When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.
  "To be continued,"  she said, tossing the magazine on the table, "in our very next issue."
  "Oh,--you're Jordan Baker."
  I knew now why her face was familiar--her face pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach.
 I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.
  "If you'll get up."
  "I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon."
  "Good night,"  called Miss Baker from the stairs.
 "I haven't heard a word."
  "She's a nice girl,"  said Tom after a moment.
 "They oughtn't to let her run around the country this way."
  "Her family."
  Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.
  "Is she from New York?"  I asked quickly.
  "From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white----"
  "Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?"  demanded Tom suddenly.
 "I can't seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know----"
  "Don't believe everything you hear, Nick,"  nick advised me.
  I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home.
 They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light.
 We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.
"  " That's right," corroborated Tom kindly. " We heard that you were engaged.
"  " It's libel.
"  " But we heard it," insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. " We heard it from three people so it must be true.
"  " I can't complain," answered Wilson unconvincingly. " When are you going to sell me that car?
"  " Next week; I've got my man working on it now.
"  " Works pretty slow, don't he?
"  " I don't mean that," explained Wilson quickly. " I just meant----"  wilson voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. a woman blocked out the light from the office door was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but a woman blocked out the light from the office door carried a woman blocked out the light from the office door surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. a woman blocked out the light from the office door face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about a woman blocked out the light from the office door as if the nerves of a woman blocked out the light from the office door body were continually smouldering. a woman blocked out the light from the office door smiled slowly and walking through a woman blocked out the light from the office door husband as if her husband were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking her husband flush in the eye. Then a woman blocked out the light from the office door wet a woman blocked out the light from the office door lips and without turning around spoke to a woman blocked out the light from the office door husband in a soft, coarse voice:  " Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down.
"  " Oh, sure," agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled wilson dark suit and wilson pale hair as his dark suit veiled everything in the vicinity--except wilson wife, who moved close to Tom.  " I want to see you," said Tom intently. " Get on the next train.
"  She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from george wilson office door.  We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.  " Terrible place, isn't it," said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.  " Awful.
"  " It does her good to get away.
"  " Wilson?
 He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York.
 He's so dumb he doesn't know he's alive.
"  So Tom Buchanan and tom girl and I went up together to New York--or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.  mrs. wilson had changed mrs. wilson dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over mrs. wilson rather wide hips as Tom helped mrs. wilson to the platform in New York. At the news-stand mrs. wilson bought a copy of " Town Tattle" and a moving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive mrs. wilson let four taxi cabs drive away before mrs. wilson selected a new one, lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately mrs. wilson turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass.  " I want to get one of those dogs," mrs. wilson said earnestly. " I want to get one for the apartment.
 They're nice to have--a dog.
"  We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to john d. rockefeller neck, cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.  " What kind are they?
" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as mrs. wilson came to the taxi-window.  " All kinds.
 What kind do you want, lady?
"  The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in the man hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.  " That's no police dog," said Tom.  " No, it's not exactly a police dog," said the man with disappointment in the man voice. " It's more of an airedale.
" He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back. " Look at that coat.
 Some coat.
"  " I think it's cute," said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. " How much is it?
"  " That dog?
" He looked at it admiringly. " That dog will cost you ten dollars.
"  The airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere though an airedale concerned in it feet were startlingly white--changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson's lap, where mrs. wilson fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.  " Is it a boy or a girl?
" she asked delicately.  " That dog?
"  " It's a bitch," said Tom decisively. " Here's your money.
 Go and buy ten more dogs with it.
"  We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.  " Hold on," I said, " I have to leave you here.
"  " No, you don't," interposed Tom quickly. " Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't come up to the apartment.
"  " Come on," she urged. " I'll telephone my sister Catherine.
 She's said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.
 I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when a woman gave me the bill you'd of thought a woman had my appendicitus out.
"  " What was the name of the woman?
 She goes around looking at people's feet in people own homes.
"  Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising mrs. wilson eyebrow in disdain.  " It's just a crazy old thing," mrs. wilson said. " I just slip it on sometimes when I don't care what I look like.
"  " But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean," pursued Mrs. McKee. " If Chester could only get you in that pose I think chester could make something of it.
"  We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded mr. mckee intently with mr. mckee head on one side and then moved mr. mckee hand back and forth slowly in front of mr. mckee face.  " I should change the light," mr. mckee said after a moment. " I'd like to bring out the modelling of the features.
"  " I wouldn't think of changing the light," cried Mrs. McKee. " I think it's----"  Her husband said " Sh!
 You have to keep after them all the time.
"  She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed the dog with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.  " I've done some nice things out on Long Island," asserted Mr. McKee.  Tom looked at tom blankly.  " Two of them we have framed downstairs.
"  " Two what?
" demanded Tom.  " Two studies.
' "  The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.  " Do you live down on Long Island, too?
"  " Really?
 I was down there at a party about a month ago.
 Do you know him?
"  " Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's.
"  " Really?
"  She nodded.  " I'm scared of him.
"  This absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:  " Chester, I think you could do something with chester," chester broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned mr. mckee attention to Tom.  " I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry.
"  " Ask Myrtle," said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. " mrs. wilson'll give you a letter of introduction, won't you, Myrtle?
" she asked, startled.  " You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so your husband can do some studies of your husband.
 Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like that.
"  Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: " Neither of them can stand the person they're married to.
" She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. " What I say is, why go on living with them if they can't stand them?
 If I was them I'd get a divorce and get married to each other right away.
"  " Doesn't she like Wilson either?
"  The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene.  " You see?
 She's a Catholic and they don't believe in divorce.
"  Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.  " When they do get married," continued Catherine, " they're going west to live for a while until it blows over.
"  " It'd be more discreet to go to Europe.
"  " Oh, do you like Europe?
"  " Really.
"  " No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back.
 We went by way of Marseilles.
 We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms.
"  The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.  " I almost made a mistake, too," mrs. mckee declared vigorously. " I almost married a little kyke who'd been after me for years.
 I knew he was below me.
' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure.
"  " Yes, but listen," said Myrtle Wilson, nodding myrtle wilson head up and down, " at least you didn't marry her head.
"  " I know I didn't.
"  " Well, I married him," said Myrtle, ambiguously. " And that's the difference between your case and mine.
"  " Why did you, Myrtle?
"  Myrtle considered.  " I married   because I thought   was a gentleman," she said finally. " I thought   knew something about breeding, but   wasn't fit to lick my shoe.
" cried Myrtle incredulously. " Who said I was crazy about him?
 I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.
"  She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.  " The only crazy I was was when I married him.
 I knew right away I made a mistake.
 He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when the man was out.
 She looked around to see who was listening: " 'Oh, is that your suit?' I said. 'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon."
  "She really ought to get away from him,"  resumed Catherine to me.
 "They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the first sweetie she ever had."
 Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering.
 I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.
  Myrtle pulled   myrtle chair close to her chair, and suddenly   myrtle warm breath poured over me the story of   myrtle first meeting with Tom.
 McKee and the room rang full of  mckee artificial laughter.
  "My dear,"  my dear cried, "I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm through with this dress. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to make a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't forget all the things I got to do."
 Mr.
 Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs.
 Wilson had any right to mention Daisy's name.
  "Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!"  shouted Mrs.
 Wilson.
  Making a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.
 Mr.
 When he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene--his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of "Town Tattle"  over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.
  "Come to lunch some day,"  he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.
  "Anywhere."
  "I beg your pardon,"  said Mr.
 McKee with dignity, "I didn't know I was touching it."
  .
 .
 .
 I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.
  "Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . . Brook'n Bridge . . . ."
  Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning "Tribune"  and waiting for the four o'clock train.
  By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums.
 A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies the orchestra leader rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray's understudy from the "Follies."  The party has begun.
 They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door.
 A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from  a chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg blue employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, the honor said, if I would attend  a chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg blue "little party"  that night.
 He had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented a peculiar combination of circumstances--signed Jay Gatsby in a majestic hand.
 I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans.
 I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles.
 They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.
  I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.
  "Hello!"  I roared, advancing toward her.
 My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.
 "I remembered you lived next door to----"
  She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps.
  "Hello!"  they cried together.
 "Sorry you didn't win."
 She had lost in the finals the week before.
  "You don't know who we are,"  said one of the girls in yellow, "but we met you here about a month ago."
  "You've dyed your hair since then,"  remarked Jordan, and I started but the girls had moved casually on and jordan remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's basket.
 With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden.
 A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr.
 Mumble.
  "Do you come to these parties often?"  inquired Jordan of the girl beside the girl.
  "The last one was the one I met you at,"  answered the girl, in an alert, confident voice.
  It was for Lucille, too.
  "I like to come,"  Lucille said.
  "Did you keep it?"  asked Jordan.
  "There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that,"  said the other girl eagerly.
 "He doesn't want any trouble with anybody."
  "Gatsby. Somebody told me----"
  "Somebody told me they thought somebody killed a man once."
 The three Mr.
  "Oh, no,"  said the first girl, "it couldn't be that, because he was in the American army during the war."  As our credulity switched back to the first girl the first girl leaned forward with enthusiasm.
 "You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man."
 It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.
  The first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join jordan own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden.
 There were three married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield jordan up jordan person to a greater or lesser degree.
  "Let's get out,"  whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour.
  We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy.
 She couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the veranda.
 On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.
 As we entered   wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.
  "What do you think?"  he demanded impetuously.
  "About what?"
  He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.
  "About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They're real."
  "The books?"
  He nodded.
  Taking our skepticism for granted, granted rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the "Stoddard Lectures."
  "See!"  he cried triumphantly.
 "It's a bona fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too--didn't cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?"
  He snatched the book from me and replaced the book from me hastily on the book shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.
  "Who brought you?"  who demanded.
 "Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought."
  Jordan looked at   jordan alertly, cheerfully without answering.
  "You told us."
 A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing "stunts"  all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky.
  I was still with Jordan Baker.
 We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter.
  "Your face is familiar,"  he said, politely.
 "Weren't you in the Third Division during the war?"
  "I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before."
  We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.
  "What time?"
  It was on the tip of my tongue to ask my tongue name when Jordan looked around and smiled.
  "Having a gay time now?"  she inquired.
  For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.
  "I'm Gatsby,"  he said suddenly.
  "What!"  I exclaimed.
 It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.
 It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.
 It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.
 Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.
 Some time before he introduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.
  Almost at the moment when Mr.
 He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.
 "Excuse me. I will rejoin you later."
  When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure jordan of my surprise.
  "Who is he?"  I demanded.
 "Do you know?"
  "He's just a man named Gatsby."
  "Now you're started on the subject,"  she answered with a wan smile.
 "Well,--he told me once he was an Oxford man."
  Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl's "I think he killed a man,"  and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity.
  "Anyhow he gives large parties,"  said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete.
 "At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation."  mr. vladimir tostoff smiled with jovial condescension and added "Some sensation!"  whereupon everybody laughed.
  The nature of Mr.
 Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as  tostoff's composition began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes.
 His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though  his tanned skin were trimmed every day.
 When the "Jazz History of the World"  was over girls were putting girls heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing that some one would arrest some one falls--but no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.
  "Miss Baker?"    "miss baker?"   inquired.
  "With me?"  she exclaimed in surprise.
  "Yes, madame."
  She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house.
 I noticed that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.
  I was alone and it was almost two.
 For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which overhung the terrace.
 Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.
 One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside  one of the girls in yellow stood a tall, red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song.
 She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was weeping too.
 Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.
 A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.
  "She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband,"  explained a girl at my elbow.
 Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be men husbands.
 Even Jordan's party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension.
 One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and  one of the men wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals his wife appeared suddenly at  one of the men side like an angry diamond, and hissed "You promised!"  into  one of the men ear.
  "So are we."
  "Well, we're almost the last tonight,"  said one of the men sheepishly.
 "The orchestra left half an hour ago."
  In spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night.
 He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.
  Jordan's party were calling impatiently to   jordan from the porch but   jordan lingered for a moment to shake hands.
 "How long were we in there?"
  "It was--simply amazing,"  she repeated abstractedly.
  Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him.
 "And don't forget we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock."
  "Good night."
  "Good night."  He smiled--and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time.
 "Good night, old sport. . . . Good night."
 In the ditch beside the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby's drive not two minutes before.
 However, as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.
  "See!"  he explained.
 "It went in the ditch."
  The fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the man--it was the late patron of Gatsby's library.
  "I know nothing whatever about mechanics,"    said decisively.
  "Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night."
  "Do you want to commit suicide?"
  "You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!"
  "You don't understand,"  explained the criminal.
  The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained "Ah-h-h!"  as the door of the coupé swung slowly open.
 The crowd--it was now a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause.
 "Did we run outa gas?"
  "It came off,"  some one explained.
  A pause.
 Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice:  "Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?"
  At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.
  "No harm in trying,"  he said.
  The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home.
 On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.
 There were generally a few rioters around but a few rioters never came into the library so it was a good place to work.
 At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and every one knew her name.
 Then it was something more.
 At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round.
  Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because   jordan baker felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible.
 She wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.
  It made no difference to me.
 It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car.
 "Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtn't to drive at all."
  "No, you're not."
  "Well, other people are,"  she said lightly.
  "What's that got to do with it?"
  "They'll keep out of my way,"  my way insisted.
  "Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself."
 Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.
 "One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass."
 It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds and headed "This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922."  But I can still read the grey names and the grey names will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid gatsby the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about gatsby.

  In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and Mr.

 P.
  All these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.
   At nine o'clock, one morning late in July Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three noted horn.
  "Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I thought we'd ride up together."
 He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.
  "It's pretty, isn't it, old sport."  He jumped off to give me a better view.
 "Haven't you ever seen it before?"
 Everybody had seen it.
 It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns.
 We hadn't reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving gatsby elegant sentences unfinished and slapping gatsby indecisively on the knee of gatsby caramel-colored suit.
 "What's your opinion of me, anyhow?"
  So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.
  "San Francisco."
  "After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago."
  "Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when a commission began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last the infantry found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a decoration--even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!"
  Little Montenegro!
 The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people.
 It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart.
  It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires.
 There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.
  Then it was all true.
 "You'll hear about it this afternoon."
  "At lunch?"
  "No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker to tea."
 We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds.
  "All right, old sport,"  called Gatsby.
 "The picture of Oxford?"
  "I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and the commissioner sends me a Christmas card every year."
 The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in  the city seen from the queensboro bridge first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.
 The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby's splendid car was included in  the friends somber holiday.
 As we crossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl.
  "Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem."
  "What?"  I inquired politely.
  But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.
  "Highballs?"  asked the head waiter.
  "This is a nice restaurant here,"  said Mr.
 Wolfshiem: "It's too hot over there."
  "Hot and small--yes,"  said Mr.
 Wolfshiem, "but full of memories."
  "The old Metropole.  " The old Metropole," brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. " Filled with faces dead and gone.
  " 'Let the bastards come in here if the bastards want you, Rosy, but don't you, so help me, move outside this room.'  " It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds we'd of seen daylight.
" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. " I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion.
"  The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for gatsby:  " Oh, no," gatsby exclaimed, " this isn't the man!
"  " No?
" Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.  " This is just a friend.
"  A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. mr. wolfshiem eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room--mr. wolfshiem completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, mr. wolfshiem would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.  " Look here, old sport," said Gatsby, leaning toward me, " I'm afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.
"  There was the smile again, but this time I held out against the smile.  " I don't like mysteries," I answered. " And I don't understand why you won't come out frankly and tell me what you want.
 Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?
"  " Oh, it's nothing underhand," he assured me. " Miss Baker's a great sportswoman, you know, and miss baker'd never do anything that wasn't all right.
"  " Yes.
"  " He's an Oggsford man.
"  " Oh!
 You know Oggsford College?
"  " It's one of the most famous colleges in the world.
"  " Yeah.
"  When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank mr. wolfshiem coffee with a jerk and got to mr. wolfshiem feet.  " I have enjoyed my lunch," mr. wolfshiem said, " and I'm going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.
"  As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.  " He becomes very sentimental sometimes," explained Gatsby. " This is one of his sentimental days.
"  " Who is he anyhow--an actor?
"  " No.
"  " A dentist?
"  " Meyer Wolfshiem?
"  " Fixed the World's Series?
"  " Why isn't he in jail?
"  " They can't get him, old sport.
"  When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.  " Where've you been?
"  " This is Mr.
 Gatsby, Mr.
 Buchanan.
"  They shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's face.  " How've you been, anyhow?
" demanded Tom of me. " How'd you happen to come up this far to eat?
"  " What's the matter, Daisy?
 Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her mine.
 Say 'Daisy's change' daisy mine!

" and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together--it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers too because the girl who was with him arm was broken--the girl who was with him was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.  The next April Daisy had the girl who was with him little girl and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but daisy came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because daisy doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all--and yet there's something in that voice of daisy. . . .  Well, about six weeks ago, daisy heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home daisy came into my room and woke me up, and said " What Gatsby?
"  " Why not?
"  Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor.  " He wants to know--" continued Jordan " --if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.
"  " He wants her to see his house," she explained. " And your house is right next door.
"  " Oh!
"  " I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night," went on Jordan, " but she never did.
 He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy's name.
"  " She's not to know about it.
"  We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. the girl wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew the girl up again, closer, this time to my face.  Chapter 5 When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.  At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into " hide-and-go-seek" or " sardines-in-the-box" with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across gatsby lawn.  " Your place looks like the world's fair," I said.  " Does the world's fair?
 In my car.
"  " Oh, that's all right," he said carelessly. " I don't want to put you to any trouble.
"  " Who is 'Tom'?
"  " What grass?
 They're fine!

old sport.
" He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. " I can't wait all day.
"  " Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four.
"  He sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.  Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.  " Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?
"  The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took her hand to help her from the car.  " Are you in love with me," she said low in my ear. " Or why did I have to come alone?
"  A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room.  Gatsby, gatsby hands still in gatsby pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. gatsby head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position gatsby distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair.  " We've met before," muttered Gatsby. gatsby eyes glanced momentarily at gatsby and gatsby lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of gatsby head, whereupon gatsby turned and caught the clock with trembling fingers and set the clock back in place. Then gatsby sat down, rigidly, gatsby elbow on the arm of the sofa and gatsby chin in gatsby hand.  " I'm sorry about the clock," gatsby said.  My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.  " It's an old clock," I told them idiotically.  I think we all believed for a moment that that had smashed in pieces on the floor.  " We haven't met for many years," said Daisy, daisy voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.  " Five years next November.
"  The automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.  Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got gatsby into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.  " Where are you going?
" in a miserable way.  " What's the matter?
" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.  " I want you and Daisy to come over to my house," daisy said, " I'd like to show daisy around.
"  " You're sure you want me to come?
"  " I thought you inherited your money.
"  " I did, old sport," he said automatically, " but I lost most of old sport in the big panic--the panic of the war.
"  I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered " That's my affair," before he realized that it wasn't the appropriate reply.  " Oh, I've been in several things," he corrected himself. " I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business.
"  " That?
 Dan Cody, old sport.
"  The name sounded faintly familiar.  " He's dead now.
"  There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau--Gatsby with gatsby head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently when gatsby was about eighteen.  " I adore it!

"  He went out of the room calling " Ewing!
" and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed in a " sport shirt" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.  " Did we interrupt your exercises?

"  As though they cared!  " Sit right down.

"  " Oh, yes," said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering. " So we did.
"  " About two weeks ago.
"  " Next door.
"  " That so?
"  " Certainly.
"  " Be ver' nice," said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. " Well--think ought to be starting home.
"  This included me. Mr. Sloane got to mr. sloane feet.  " Come along," mr. sloane said--but to mr. sloane only.  " I mean it," mr. sloane insisted. " I'd love to have you.
 Lots of room.
"  The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.  " My God, I believe the man's coming," said Tom. " Doesn't the man know tom doesn't want the man?
"  " She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there.
"  Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.  " Come on," said Mr. Sloane to Tom, " we're late.
 Just mention my name.
"  He took them ceremoniously from group to group:  " Mrs.

"  " Go ahead," answered Daisy genially, " And if you want to take down any addresses here's my little gold pencil.

 .
" She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was " common but pretty," and I knew that except for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having a good time.  We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had been called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.  " How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?
"  The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry the girl addressed sat up and opened the girl addressed eyes.  " Wha?
 When she's had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that.
"  " Where'd you hear that?
"  A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.  " At least they're more interesting than the people we know," she said with an effort.  " You didn't look so interested.
"  " I'd like to know who he is and what he does," insisted Tom. " And I think I'll make a point of finding out.
"  " She didn't like it," he insisted. " She didn't have a good time.
"  He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.  " I feel far away from her," he said. " It's hard to make her understand.
"  " You mean about the dance?
"  " The dance?
"  He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that daisy should go to Tom and say: " I never loved you.
" After she had obliterated three years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five years ago.  " And she doesn't understand," one of them said. " She used to be able to understand.
"  " Nope.

"  My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from my commutation ticket hand. That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips whose kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over whose heart!  . . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.  " The master's body!

  "I'm right across from you."
  "What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon,"  cried Daisy, "and the day after that, and the next thirty years?"
  "Don't be morbid,"  Jordan said.
  "I've heard of making a garage out of a stable,"  Tom was saying to Gatsby, "but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage."
  "All right,"  broke in Tom quickly, "I'm perfectly willing to go to town. Come on--we're all going to town."
 "Like this? Aren't we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?"
  "Oh."
  A pause.
  "Shall we take anything to drink?"  called Daisy from an upper window.
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .
  "Yes."
  A pause followed this apparently pointless remark.
  "See what?"
  "What?"  Confused, confused stared at us as we laughed.
 "A medium?"
  "An Oxford man!"    "an oxford man!"   was incredulous.
 J.
 "What do you think we stopped for--to admire the view?"
  "I'm sick,"  said Wilson without moving.
  "I'm all run down."
  "Dollar twenty."
 I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.
  "I'll let you have that car,"  said Tom.
 J.
 Her expression was curiously familiar-- her expression was an expression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be tom wife.
   There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.
  "Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,"  suggested Jordan.
  "How about the movies?"
  Several times he turned his head and looked back for   several times car, and if the traffic delayed   several times he slowed up until   several times came into sight.

  A pause.
  Another pause.
 "We could go to any of the universities in England or France."
 "And I'll make you a mint julep. Then you won't seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!"
  They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.
  "He isn't causing a row."  Daisy looked desperately from one to the other.
  "Self control!"  repeated Tom incredulously.
  "I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose you've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends--in the modern world."
  Tom turned to Daisy sharply.
  "No."
 ". . . Daisy?"
  "Even that's a lie,"  said Tom savagely.
  "Nonsense."
 "I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn't too proud to come in on it."
  "Nick?"  He asked again.
  "What?"
  "No . . . I just remembered that today's my birthday."
 Human sympathy has  human limits and we were content to let all  human sympathy tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind.
  The "death car"  as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend.
 The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and new york driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, myrtle wilson life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled myrtle wilson thick, dark blood with the dust.
  "There's some bad trouble here,"  said Tom excitedly.
  "O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!"
  "g----"
  "Hasn't got any name."
  A pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.
  "You don't have to tell me what kind of car what kind of car was! I know what kind of car what kind of car was!"
  "I'm a friend of his."  Tom turned tom head but kept tom hands firm on Wilson's body.
  "And what color's your car?"
  "Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----"
  Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried wilson into the office, set wilson down in a chair and came back.
  "The God Damn coward!"    "the god damn coward!"   whimpered.
 "He didn't even stop his car."
  "I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can do tonight."
  "I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper--if you want any."  jordan opened the door.
  "No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait outside."
  "Won't you come in, Nick?"
  "No thanks."
 Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate.
  I hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path.
 I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.
  "Yes."
  "Yes."
"  " He won't touch her," I said. " He's not thinking about her.
"  " I don't trust him, old sport.
"  " How long are you going to wait?
"  " All night if necessary.
"  He wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew what daisy was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn't bear to shake him free.  It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody--told it to me because " Jay Gatsby" had broken up like glass against Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.  daisy was the first " nice" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found daisy excitingly desirable. He went to daisy house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to daisy as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through place corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased daisy value in his eyes. He felt many men had already loved daisy presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.  But he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of a penniless young man uniform might slip from a penniless young man shoulders. So a penniless young man made the most of a penniless young man time. a penniless young man took what a penniless young man could get, ravenously and unscrupulously--eventually a penniless young man took Daisy one still October night, took daisy because a penniless young man had no real right to touch daisy hand.  a penniless young man might have despised a penniless young man, for a penniless young man had certainly taken daisy under false pretenses. I don't mean that a penniless young man had traded on a penniless young man phantom millions, but a penniless young man had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; a penniless young man let daisy believe that a penniless young man was a person from much the same stratum as daisy--that a penniless young man was fully able to take care of daisy. As a matter of fact a penniless young man had no such facilities--a penniless young man had no comfortable family standing behind a penniless young man and a penniless young man was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.  But a penniless young man didn't despise a penniless young man and it didn't turn out as a penniless young man had imagined. a penniless young man had intended, probably, to take what a penniless young man could and go--but now a penniless young man found that a penniless young man had committed a penniless young man to the following of a grail. a penniless young man knew that Daisy was extraordinary but a penniless young man didn't realize just how extraordinary a " nice" girl could be. daisy vanished into daisy rich house, into daisy rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. a penniless young man felt married to daisy, that was all.  When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was somehow betrayed. daisy porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as daisy turned toward a penniless young man and a penniless young man kissed daisy curious and lovely mouth. daisy had caught a cold and a cold made daisy voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.   " I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved daisy, old sport.

"  On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and daisy cheeks flushed. Now and then daisy moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed daisy dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when daisy brushed silent lips against his coat's shoulder or when he touched the end of daisy fingers, gently, as though daisy were asleep.   He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. daisy didn't see why he couldn't come. daisy was feeling the pressure of the world outside and daisy wanted to see him and feel his presence beside daisy and be reassured that daisy was doing the right thing after all.  For Daisy was young and daisy artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the " Beale Street Blues" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.  Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly daisy was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside daisy bed. And all the time something within daisy was crying for a decision. daisy wanted daisy life shaped now, immediately--and the decision must be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality--that was close at hand.  That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about a wholesome bulkiness person and a wholesome bulkiness position and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while gatsby was still at Oxford.   the letter was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning, gold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool lovely day.  " I don't think she ever loved him.
"  Suddenly he came out with a curious remark:  " In any case," he said, " it was just personal.
"  What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?  He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in daisy white car. Just as Daisy's house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself, even though daisy was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.  He left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found daisy--that he was leaving daisy behind. The day-coach--he was penniless now--was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of daisy face along the casual street.  The track curved and now the track was going away from the sun which, as the track sank lower, seemed to spread the track in benediction over the vanishing city where daisy had drawn daisy breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that daisy had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.  It was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's former servants, came to the foot of the steps.  " I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr.
"  " Don't do it today," Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically. " You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?
"  I didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than that--I didn't want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.  " I'll call you up," I said finally.  " Do, old sport.
"  " Well--goodbye.
"   Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; jordan baker often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of jordan baker own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made jordan baker hard to find in any other way. Usually jordan baker voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window seemed harsh and dry.  " I've left Daisy's house," daisy said. " I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down to Southampton this afternoon.
"  Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act annoyed me and daisy next remark made me rigid.  " You weren't so nice to me last night.
"  " How could it have mattered then?
"  Silence for a moment. Then--  " However--I want to see you.
"  " No--I don't think this afternoon.
"  " Very well.
"  " Twelve years.
 Maybe even if you haven't been there for a long time?
"  " Don't belong to any.
 Didn't you get married in a church?
"  The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking--for a moment he was silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.  " Look in the drawer there," he said, pointing at the desk.  " Which drawer?
"  " That drawer--that one.
"  " She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.
"  " I know," he said definitely, " I'm one of these trusting fellas and I don't think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it.
 She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn't stop.
 You may fool me but you can't fool God!
' "  Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that michaelis was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night.  " God sees everything," repeated Wilson.  " That's an advertisement," Michaelis assured michaelis. Something made michaelis turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, wilson face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.   By six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so michaelis cooked breakfast for three which michaelis and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went home to sleep; when michaelis awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage Wilson was gone.  michaelis movements--michaelis was on foot all the time--were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where michaelis bought a sandwich that michaelis didn't eat and a cup of coffee. michaelis must have been tired and walking slowly for michaelis didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for michaelis time--there were boys who had seen a man " acting sort of crazy" and motorists at whom michaelis stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours michaelis disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what michaelis said to Michaelis, that michaelis " had a way of finding out," supposed that michaelis spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand no garage man who had seen michaelis ever came forward--and perhaps michaelis had an easier, surer way of finding out what michaelis wanted to know. By half past two michaelis was in West Egg where michaelis asked someone the way to Gatsby's house. So by that time michaelis knew Gatsby's name.   At two o'clock Gatsby put on michaelis bathing suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to michaelis at the pool. michaelis stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused michaelis guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped michaelis pump the garage up. Then michaelis gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out under any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right fender needed repair.  Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once gatsby stopped and shifted the mattress a little, and the chauffeur asked gatsby if the chauffeur needed help, but the chauffeur shook the chauffeur head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.  No telephone message arrived but the butler went without gatsby sleep and waited for the butler until four o'clock--until long after there was any one to give the butler to if the butler came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't believe it would come and perhaps gatsby no longer cared. If that was true gatsby must have felt that gatsby had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. gatsby must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as gatsby found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about . . . like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward gatsby through the amorphous trees.  The chauffeur--the chauffeur was one of Wolfshiem's protégés--heard the shots--afterward gatsby could only say that gatsby hadn't thought anything much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.  There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged one end way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb a small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface accidental course with a small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle in the water.  It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.  Chapter 9 After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that little boys could enter through my yard and there were always a few of little boys clustered open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression " mad man" as someone bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of someone voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.  Most of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque, circumstantial, eager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson's suspicions of michaelis wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn't say a word. his wife showed a surprising amount of character about it too--looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of his wife and swore that his wife sister had never seen Gatsby, that his wife sister was completely happy with her sister husband, that her sister sister had been into no mischief whatever. his wife convinced his wife of it and cried into his wife handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than his wife could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man " deranged by grief" in order that the case might remain in the case simplest form. And the case rested there.  But all this part of the case seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end.  I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called daisy instinctively and without hesitation. But daisy and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.  " Left no address?
"  " No.
"  " Say when they'd be back?
"  " No.
"  " Any idea where they are?
"  " I don't know.
 Just trust me and I'll get somebody for you----"  Meyer Wolfshiem's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me the butler office address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone.  " Will you ring again?
"  " Sorry.
 I can't go through this alone.
"  Some one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall.  Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote that request. I was sure he'd start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire from Daisy before noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived, no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem's answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.  Dear Mr. Carraway.     This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe this that this is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.                                                                              Yours truly                                                                                             MEYER WOLFSHIEM  and then hasty addenda beneath:  Let me know about the funeral etc do not know                                                                                             meyer wolfshiem   family at all.  When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man's voice, very thin and far away.  " This is Slagle speaking.
 .
 .
 .
"  " Yes?
"  " There haven't been any wires.
"  " I didn't know how to reach you.
"  " Wouldn't you like some coffee?
----"  " Carraway.
"  " Well, I'm all right now.
"  " --Mr.
--?
"  " He had a big future before him, you know.
 Hill.
"  I ejaculated an unrestrained " Huh!
 I wonder if it'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on.
 F.
----"  I didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver.  After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that gatsby--one gentleman to whom i telephoned had got what gatsby--one gentleman to whom i telephoned deserved. However, that was my fault, for gatsby--one gentleman to whom i telephoned was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known better than to call gatsby--one gentleman to whom i telephoned.   The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn't seem to reach meyer wolfshiem any other way. The door that I pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked " The Swastika Holding Company" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside. But when I'd shouted " Hello" several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.  " Nobody's in," she said. " Mr.
"  The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle " The Rosary," tunelessly, inside.  " Please say that Mr.
 Carraway wants to see  carraway.
"  At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem's called " Stella!
 He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days.
"  " Oh.
 Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany.
"  " Very well.
"  He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held the picture for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called " Hopalong Cassidy.

 "It just shows you, don't it?"
 But it wasn't any use.
 I don't know how he knew about the funeral or even his name.
  "I couldn't get to the house,"  he remarked.
 Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a December evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye.
  She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee.
 I doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to be surprised.
  She didn't answer.
  "Yes. You know what I think of you."
 "Crazy as hell. I don't know what's the matter with you."
  "Tom,"  I inquired, "what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?"
  "I told him the truth,"  he said.
  There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn't true.
  "And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful----"
 They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.

 One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was  one of the taxi drivers in the village who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps  one of the taxi drivers in the village had made a story about it all  one of the taxi drivers in the village own.
 I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.
 But I didn't investigate.
 Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.
  Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.
 Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held a transitory enchanted moment man breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation a transitory enchanted moment man neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to a transitory enchanted moment man capacity for wonder.
  And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.
 He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.
