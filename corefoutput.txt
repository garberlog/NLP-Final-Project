0	"I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and tell you he's the one. Or at least as close as we're going to get." 
1	 "That's what you said about the brother." 
2	 "The brother tested out impossible. For other reasons. Nothing to do with the brother ability." 
3	 "Same with the sister. And there are doubts about the brother. the brother's too malleable. Too willing to submerge the brother in someone else's will." 
4	 "Not if the other person is the other person enemy." 
5	 "So what do we do? Surround the brother with enemies all the time?" 
6	 "If we have to." 
7	 "I thought you said you liked this kid." 
8	 "If the buggers get this kid, the buggers get him'll make me look like this kid favorite uncle." 
9	 "All right. We're saving the world, after all. Take his favorite uncle." 
10	 *** The monitor lady smiled very nicely and tousled his favorite uncle hair and said, "Andrew, I suppose by now you're just absolutely sick of having that horrid monitor. Well, I have good news for you. That monitor is going to come out today. We're going to just take that monitor right out, and that monitor won't hurt a bit." 
11	 Ender nodded. 
12	 It was a lie, of course, that it wouldn't hurt a bit. 
13	 But since adults always said it when it was going to hurt,  ender could count on that statement as an accurate prediction of the future. 
14	 Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth. 
15	 "So if you'll just come over here, Andrew, just sit right up here on the examining table. The doctor will be in to see you in a moment." 
16	  The monitor gone. 
17	 Ender tried to imagine the little device missing from the back of  ender neck. 
18	 I'll roll over on my back in bed and it won't be pressing there. 
19	 I won't feel it tingling and taking up the heat when I shower. 
20	 And Peter won't hate me anymore. 
21	 I'll come home and show  that the monitor's gone, and  'll see that I didn't make it, either. 
22	 That I'll just be a normal kid now, like  . 
23	 That won't be so bad then. 
24	  'll forgive me that I had my monitor a whole year longer than  had  . 
25	 We'll be-- not friends, probably. 
26	 No, Peter was too dangerous. 
27	 Peter got so angry. 
28	 Brothers, though. 
29	 Not enemies, not friends, but brothers-- able to live in the same house. 
30	 peter won't hate me, peter'll just leave me alone. 
31	 And when peter wants to play buggers and astronauts, maybe I won't have to play, maybe I can just go read a book. 
32	 But Ender knew, even as peter thought it, that Peter wouldn't leave peter alone. 
33	 There was something in Peter's eyes, when peter was in peter mad mood, and whenever Ender saw that look, that glint, peter knew that the one thing Peter would not do was leave peter alone. 
34	 I'm practicing piano, Ender. 
35	 Come turn the pages for me. 
36	 Oh, is the monitor boy too busy to help ender brother? 
37	 Is the monitor boy too busy to help his brother too smart? 
38	 Got to go kill some buggers, astronaut? 
39	 No, no, I don't want your help. 
40	 I can do it on my own, you little bastard, you little Third. 
41	  "This won't take long, Andrew," said the doctor. 
42	 Ender nodded. 
43	 "It's designed to be removed. Without infection, without damage. But there'll be some tickling, and some people say some people have a feeling of something missing. You'll keep looking around for something. Something you were looking for, but you can't find it, and you can't remember what it was. So I'll tell you. It's the monitor you're looking for, and it isn't there. In a few days that feeling will pass." 
44	 The doctor was twisting something at the back of Ender's head. 
45	 Suddenly a pain stabbed through  the doctor like a needle from  the doctor neck to  the doctor groin. 
46	 Ender felt  ender back spasm, and  ender body arched violently backward; hi head struck the bed. 
47	  ender could feel  ender legs thrashing, and  ender hands were clenching each other, wringing each other so tightly that each other ached. 
48	 "Deedee!" shouted the doctor. 
49	 "I need you!" The nurse ran in, gasped. 
50	 "Got to relax these muscles. Get these muscles to me, now! What are you waiting for!" 
51	 Something changed hands; Ender could not see. 
52	 ender lurched to one side and fell off the examining table. 
53	 "Catch ender!" cried the nurse. 
54	 "Just hold ender steady." 
55	 "You hold ender, doctor, ender's too strong for me." 
56	 "Not the whole thing! You'll stop ender heart."Ender felt a needle enter his heart."ender back just above the neck of his heart."ender shirt. 
57	 It burned, but wherever in his heart."ender the fire spread, his heart."ender muscles gradually unclenched. 
58	 Now his heart."ender could cry for the fear and pain of it. 
59	 "Are you all right, Andrew?" the nurse asked. 
60	 Andrew could not remember how to speak. 
61	 They lifted his heart."ender onto the table. 
62	 They checked his heart."ender pulse, did other things; his heart."ender did not understand it all. 
63	 The doctor was trembling;  the doctor voice shook as  the doctor spoke. 
64	 "They leave these things in the kids for three years, what do they expect? We could have switched his heart."ender off, do you realize that? We could have unplugged his heart."ender brain for all time." 
65	 "When does the drug wear off'?" asked the nurse. 
66	 "Keep his heart."ender here for at least an hour. Watch his heart."ender. If his heart."ender doesn't start talking in fifteen minutes, call me. Could have unplugged his heart."ender forever. I don't have the brains of a bugger."
