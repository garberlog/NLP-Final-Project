 By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went.
 Winston was just taking  winston place in one of the middle rows when two people whom  winston knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room.
 He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department.
 Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years.
 He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's physique.
 Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so.
 He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.
 A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them.
 The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust.
 The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically.
 He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave.
 The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out 'Swine!
 In a lucid moment Winston found that winston was shouting with the others and kicking winston heel violently against the rung of winston chair.
 The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.
 Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals:     WAR IS PEACE   FREEDOM IS SLAVERY   IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH   But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that the screen had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately.
 But don't worry, I am on your side!
 He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O'Brien again.
 It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it.
 He discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action.
 He would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre every evening for the past four years.
  Mrs Parsons' eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and back again.
  Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the Park that evening, Winston remembered.
  Back in the flat the flat stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again, still rubbing the flat neck.
 Nearly all children nowadays were horrible.
 He had walked on without pausing.
 Winston did not know what  winston meant, only that in some way or another  winston would come true.
 The voice continued raspingly:  'Attention!
 I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of the war end.
 Winston walked over to the window, keeping  winston back to the telescreen.
 There, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of the coin the head of Big Brother.
 Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you.
 His father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearing spectacles.
 He knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces.
 In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country.
 It emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps.
'  Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym-shoes, had already appeared.
 Winston and  winston mother and father found themselves a place on the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk.
 It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin.
 His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink.
 Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.
 He tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother.
 He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood.
 Just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact.
 He stood watching while the instructress raised the instructress arms above the instructress head and--one could not say gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency--bent over and tucked the first joint of the instructress fingers under the instructress toes.
 THAT'S how I want to see you doing it.
' She bent over again.
 You can all do it if you want to,' she added as she straightened herself up.
 That's better, comrade, that's MUCH better,' she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching winston toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years.
 Then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.
 To the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating.
  Winston examined the four slips of paper which   winston had unrolled.
  Winston dialled 'back numbers' on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of 'The Times', which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes' delay.
 The messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify.
 For example, it appeared from 'The Times' of the seventeenth of March that Big Brother, in big brother speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in North Africa.
  As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, winston clipped winston speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of 'The Times' and pushed them into the pneumatic tube.
 A number of 'The Times' which might, because of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing a dozen times original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it.
 Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie.
 A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head.
 Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled.
  Winston glanced across the hall.
 He looked up, and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston's direction.
 In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name, though winston daily saw quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate.
 He knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the Press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed.
  Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston was working, but   three messages were simple matters, and winston had disposed of   three messages before the Two Minutes Hate interrupted winston.
 He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier.
   Winston read through the offending article.
 Big Brother's Order for the Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the Floating Fortresses.
 More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again.
 Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not counting winston parents, had disappeared at one time or another.
 He raised his head for a moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash.
 Very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said.
  Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced.
 Very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever.
 He did not exist: he had never existed.
 Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of Big Brother's speech.
  He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the Ninth Three-Year Plan, might complicate the records too much.
  Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards   winston and began dictating in Big Brother's familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering asking questions ('What lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades?
 The lesson--which is also one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc--that,' etc.
 At six--a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules--he had joined the Spies, at nine he had been a troop leader.
 At twenty-three he had perished in action.
 Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity and single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy's life.
 He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, and no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals, and traitors generally.
  Winston debated with   winston whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit: in the end   winston decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.
  Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle.
  'Just the man I was looking for,' said a voice at Winston's back.
  He turned round.
  'I wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor blades,' you'd got any razor blades said.
' said Winston with a sort of guilty haste.
  'I've been using the same blade for six weeks,' he added untruthfully.
  'Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?
  'I was working,' said Winston indifferently.
 'I shall see it on the flicks, I suppose.
  His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face.
 Winston turned  winston head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.
 'I think it spoils it when they tie their feet together.
  Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille.
 Winston took up  winston mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect  winston nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down.
 When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry.
 He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat.
 From the table at Winston's left, a little behind winston back, someone was talking rapidly and continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which pierced the general uproar of the room.
' said Winston, raising winston voice to overcome the noise.
  'Slowly,' said Syme.
'  He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak.
 He pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting.
  'The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,' he said.
 When we've finished with it, people like you will have to learn it all over again.
 You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words.
 We're destroying words--scores of them, hundreds of them, every day.
 We're cutting the language down to the bone.
 The Eleventh Edition won't contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year 2050.
'  He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then continued speaking, with a sort of pedant's passion.
 A word contains  a word opposite in  a word.
 If you have a word like "good" , what need is there for a word like "bad" ?
 Or again, if you want a stronger version of "good" , what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like "excellent"  and "splendid"  and all the rest of them?
 "Plusgood"  covers the meaning, or "doubleplusgood"  if you want something stronger still.
 Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston?
  A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston's face at the mention of Big Brother.
  'You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,' he said almost sadly.
 'Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak.
 I've read some of those pieces that you write in "The Times"  occasionally.
 They're good enough, but they're translations.
 In your heart you'd prefer to stick to Oldspeak, with all oldspeak vagueness and oldspeak useless shades of meaning.
 You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words.
 Do you know that Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?
'  Winston did know that, of course.
 Syme bit off another fragment of the dark-coloured bread, chewed the dark-coloured bread briefly, and went on:  'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought?
 Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that point.
 But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead.
 'Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?
  It had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'Except the proles,' but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox.
 In fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now.
'  One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will be vaporized.
 He is too intelligent.
 It is written in his face.
  Winston had finished   winston bread and cheese.
 He turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee.
 At the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away.
 From time to time Winston caught some such remark as 'I think you're so right, I do so agree with you', uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice.
 Winston knew the man by sight, though  winston knew no more about the man than that the man held some important post in the Fiction Department.
 His head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which  his head was sitting,  his head spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes.
 Just once Winston caught a phrase--'complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism'--jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid.
 And yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.
 He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front--it made no difference.
 Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc.
 As   watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy.
 It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was the man larynx.
  'There is a word in Newspeak,' said Syme, 'I don't know whether you know it: DUCKSPEAK, to quack like a duck.
 It is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings.
 Applied to an opponent,  applied is abuse, applied to someone you agree with,  applied is praise.
 He thought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so.
 You could not say that he was unorthodox.
 He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach.
 He said things that would have been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut Tree Cafe, haunt of painters and musicians.
 Goldstein himself, it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago.
 And yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of syme, Winston's, secret opinions, syme would betray syme instantly to the Thought Police.
 So would anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most.
  Syme looked up.
 Parsons, Winston's fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading his way across the room--a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face.
 At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish.
 His whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red neckerchief of the Spies.
' and sat down at the table, giving off an intense smell of sweat.
 At the Community Centre you could always tell when  at the community centre had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of the bat handle.
 Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words, and was studying  syme with an ink-pencil between his fingers.
  'Look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said Parsons, nudging Winston.
 Something a bit too brainy for me, I expect.
 Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I'm chasing you.
 It's that sub you forgot to give me.
' said Winston, automatically feeling for money.
 You know--the house-by-house fund.
 I'm treasurer for our block.
 I tell you, it won't be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn't have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street.
'  Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsons entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.
  'By the way, old boy,' he said.
 'I hear that little beggar of mine let fly at little beggar of mine with little beggar of mine catapult yesterday.
 I gave him a good dressing-down for it.
 In fact I told him I'd take the catapult away if he does the catapult again.
  'Ah, well--what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't the right spirit?
 She got two other girls to go with her, slipped off from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man.
 They kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when they got into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols.
' said Winston, somewhat taken aback.
 Parsons went on triumphantly:  'My kid made sure  parsons was some kind of enemy agent--might have been dropped by parachute, for instance.
 What do you think put her on to him in the first place?
 She spotted he was wearing a funny kind of shoes--said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before.
 So the chances were he was a foreigner.
' said Winston.
  'Ah, that I couldn't say, of course.
 But I wouldn't be altogether surprised if----' Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked if----' parsons tongue for the explosion.
  'Good,' said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from syme strip of paper.
  'What I mean to say, there is a war on,' said Parsons.
 However, it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty.
' cried an eager youthful voice.
 We have glorious news for you.
 We have won the battle for production!
 It had been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty.
 Parsons,  parsons attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom.
 He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that the figures were in some way a cause for satisfaction.
 He had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.
 With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top.
 Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which  winston held carefully horizontal.
 For the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen.
 It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week.
 And only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week.
 Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours?
 Yes, they swallowed it.
 Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal.
 The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed  the eyeless creature fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes.
 Syme, too--in some more complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed syme.
 Was he, then, ALONE in the possession of a memory?
 As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up winston spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern.
 Had it always been like this?
 He looked round the canteen.
 A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes.
 Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to.
 It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different.
 In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety, rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces, bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes insufficient--nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin.
 And though, of course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that this was NOT the natural order of things, if one's heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness of one's socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil tastes?
 Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different?
  He looked round the canteen again.
 How easy it was, thought Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type set up by the Party as an ideal--tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree--existed and even predominated.
 Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured.
 It was curious how that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes.
 It was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the Party.
 Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.
 'By the way, Smith old boy, I suppose you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have?
 'I've been using the same blade for six weeks myself.
  The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the Ministry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever.
 For some reason Winston suddenly found winston thinking of Mrs Parsons, with mrs parsons wispy hair and the dust in the creases of mrs parsons face.
 Mrs Parsons would be vaporized.
 Syme would be vaporized.
 Winston would be vaporized.
 Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.
 The little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of Ministries  the little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of ministries they, too, would never be vaporized.
 It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for survival, it was not easy to say.
  At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk.
 It was the girl with dark hair.
 She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curious intensity.
 The instant she caught his eye she looked away again.
  The sweat started out on Winston's backbone.
 A horrible pang of terror went through  a horrible pang.
 It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind.
 Why did she keep following him about?
 Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards.
 But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so.
 Quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.
  His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member of the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all.
 He did not know how long she had been looking at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control.
 It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen.
 The smallest thing could give you away.
 A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself--anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide.
 There was even a word for it in Newspeak: FACECRIME, it was called.
 Perhaps after all  perhaps was not really following  perhaps about, perhaps it was coincidence that  perhaps had sat so close to  perhaps two days running.
 His cigarette had gone out, and he laid  his cigarette carefully on the edge of the table.
 He would finish smoking it after work, if he could keep the tobacco in it.
 Quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely a spy of the thought police would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted.
 Syme had folded up  syme strip of paper and stowed his strip of paper away in  syme pocket.
 Parsons had begun talking again.
  'Did I ever tell you, old boy,' old boy said, chuckling round the stem of old boy pipe, 'about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old market-woman's skirt because they saw the old market-woman wrapping up sausages in a poster of B.
 Burned her quite badly, I believe.
 That's a first-rate training they give them in the Spies nowadays--better than in my day, even.
 What d'you think's the latest thing they've served them out with?
 My little girl brought one home the other night--tried one home out on our sitting-room door, and reckoned  my little girl could hear twice as much as with  my little girl ear to the hole.
 Of course it's only a toy, mind you.
 It was the signal to return to work.
 All three men sprang to  all three men feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of Winston's cigarette.
     Chapter 6    Winston was writing in      chapter 6    winston diary:           chapter 6    winston was three years ago.
 It was on a dark evening, in a narrow side-street near one of the big railway stations.
 She was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light.
 She had a young face, painted very thick.
 It was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips.
 Party women never paint  party women faces.
 She said two dollars.
 He shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring.
 He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice.
 Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window--to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him.
 He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case.
 It happened again just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual.
 He remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil is done for.
  He drew his breath and went on writing:      I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen.
 He would have liked to spit.
 Winston was married--had been married, at any rate: probably  winston still was married, so far as  winston knew  winston wife was not dead.
 He seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so.
 In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.
  When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts.
 Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break.
 It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter.
 And it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught in the act.
 Mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class.
 But--though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to--it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.
 Not love so much as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it.
 All marriages between Party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose, and--though the principle was never clearly stated--permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another.
 All children were to be begotten by artificial insemination (ARTSEM, it was called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions.
 This, Winston was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party.
 He did not know why this was so, but this seemed natural that it should be so.
  He thought again of Katharine.
 It must be nine, ten--nearly eleven years since they had parted.
 It was curious how seldom he thought of her.
 For days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married.
 The Party did not permit divorce, but  the party rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children.
 She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it.
 Very early in her married life  very had decided--though perhaps it was only that  very knew her more intimately than  very knew most people--that she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that  very had ever encountered.
 She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it out to her.
 'The human sound-track' he nicknamed her in his own mind.
 Yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing--sex.
  As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen.
 To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image.
 And what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength.
 The rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression.
 She would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but SUBMITTING.
 But even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate.
 But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.
 They must, she said, produce a child if they could.
 So the performance continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not impossible.
 She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten.
 She had two names for it.
 One was 'making a baby', and the other was 'our duty to the Party' (yes, she had actually used that phrase).
 Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round.
 He picked up his pen again and wrote:      She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up her skirt.
 Why did it always have to be like this?
 Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years?
 His reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it.
 They were all impregnable, as the Party intended that they should be.
 And what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life.
 He wrote:      I turned up the lamp.
 When I saw her in the light----   After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright.
 For the first time he could see the woman properly.
 He had taken a step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror.
 He was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here.
 It was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matter the patrols might be waiting outside the door at this moment.
  It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed.
 What he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was OLD.
 The paint was plastered so thick on her face that  the paint looked as though  the paint might crack like a cardboard mask.
 There were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness.
 She had no teeth at all.
  He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:      When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old at least.
 But I went ahead and did it just the same.
   He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again.
 He had written it down at last, but it made no difference.
 Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another.
 Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word.
 But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength.
 They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies.
 Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it?
  He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices women's voices--had burst from a side-street a little way ahead.
 It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep, loud 'Oh-o-o-o-oh!
 It's started!
 he had thought.
 The proles are breaking loose at last!
 When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship.
 It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans.
 They were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get.
 Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear hold of the same saucepan out of one another's hands.
 For a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off.
 Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?
  He wrote:      Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.
 The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles from bondage.
 Before the Revolution  before the revolution had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists,  before the revolution had been starved and flogged, women had been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age of six.
 But simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules.
 It was not necessary to know much.
 So long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance.
 They were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty.
 Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon of gambling minds.
 A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among  a few agents of the thought police, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate  a few agents of the thought police with the ideology of the Party.
 It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings.
 All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations.
 And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances.
 The great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in  the great majority of proles homes.
 Even the civil police interfered with  even the civil police very little.
 There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was of no importance.
 They were beneath suspicion.
 As the Party slogan put  : 'Proles and animals are free.
'  Winston reached down and cautiously scratched winston varicose ulcer.
 It had begun itching again.
 He took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbook which he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copying a passage into the diary:      In the old days (a passage ran), before the glorious Revolution, London was not the beautiful city that we know today.
 It was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on poor people feet and not even a roof to sleep under.
 Children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water.
 These rich men were called capitalists.
 They were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page.
 You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat.
 They owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money.
 If anyone disobeyed anyone anyone could throw anyone into prison, or anyone could take his job away and starve him to death.
 It was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories.
  How could you tell how much of it was lies?
 It MIGHT be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the Revolution.
 The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different.
 It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not modern life cruelty and insecurity, but simply modern life bareness, modern life dinginess, modern life listlessness.
 Great areas of  great, even for a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end.
 He seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.
  He reached down and scratched his ankle again.
 Day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations--that they lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years ago.
 Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved.
 The Party claimed, for example, that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate: before the Revolution, it was said, the number had only been 15 per cent.
 The Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per thousand, whereas before the Revolution the infant mortality rate had been 300--and so the infant mortality rate went on.
 It was like a single equation with two unknowns.
 It might very well be that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one accepted without question, was pure fantasy.
 For all he knew there might never have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS, or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat.
 Just once in his life he had possessed--AFTER the event: that was what counted--concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification.
 He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds.
 In 1973, it must have been--at any rate, it was at about the time when he and Katharine had parted.
 It must have been in 1965 that these three had been arrested.
 As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way.
 They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people.
 After confessing to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important.
 He remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye.
 They were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the Party.
 The glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them.
 He had the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother.
 But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two.
 No one who had once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end.
 They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe.
 Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most impressed Winston.
 They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing.
 He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips.
 At one time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction.
 He seemed to be breaking up before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling.
  It was the lonely hour of fifteen.
 Winston could not now remember how  winston had come to be in the cafe at such a time.
 The three men sat in  the three men corner almost motionless, never speaking.
 And then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something happened to the telescreens.
 The tune that they were playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too.
 There came into it--but it was something hard to describe.
 It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note.
   The three men never stirred.
 But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford's ruinous face, winston saw that winston eyes were full of tears.
 And for the first time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing AT WHAT he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.
 It appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release.
 At their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new ones.
 They were executed, and their fate was recorded in the Party histories, a warning to posterity.
 About five years after this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to winston desk when winston came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten.
 The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance.
 It was a half-page torn out of 'The Times' of about ten years earlier--the top half of the page, so that it included the date--and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York.
  The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date all three men had been on Eurasian soil.
 They had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets.
 The date had stuck in Winston's memory because  the date chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well.
 Even at that time Winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that the people who were wiped out in the purges were accused of.
 But this was concrete evidence; this was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory.
 It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way the party could have been published to the world and the party significance made known.
  He had gone straight on working.
 As soon as he saw what the photograph was, and what the photograph meant, he had covered the photograph up with another sheet of paper.
 Luckily, when  luckily unrolled  luckily,  luckily had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen.
  He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible.
 He let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear that some accident--a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for instance--would betray him.
 Today, probably, he would have kept that photograph.
 It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the event it recorded, was only memory.
 Was the Party's hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer HAD ONCE existed?
  But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence.
 Already, at the time when he made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed the three dead men country.
 Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance.
 What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken.
 He took up his pen again and wrote:      I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.
   He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was a lunatic.
 At one time  at one time had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today, to believe that the past is unalterable.
 He might be ALONE in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic.
  He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of Big Brother which formed the children's history book frontispiece.
 It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you--something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses.
 In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it.
 It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded the logic.
 And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.
 He knew, with more certainty than before, that O'Brien was on o'brien side.
 He was writing the diary for O'Brien--TO O'Brien: it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed to a particular person and took no one colour from that fact.
  The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.
 It was their final, most essential command.
 His heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand, much less answer.
 And yet he was in the right!
 They were wrong and he was right.
 The obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended.
 Truisms are true, hold on to that!
 With the feeling that he was speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote:      Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.
 For perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood.
  He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer was throbbing.
 This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked.
 In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except in bed.
 It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous.
 There was a word for it in Newspeak: OWNLIFE, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity.
 But this evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had tempted him.
 The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen  the sky that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable.
  'If there is hope,' he had written in the diary, 'the diary lies in the proles.
' The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity.
 He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slums to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station.
 He was walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes.
 In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow alley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in astonishing numbers--girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years' time, and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers.
 Winston caught scraps of conversation as  winston approached.
  '"Yes,"  I says to 'er, "that's all very well,"  I says.
 "But if you'd of been in my place you'd of done the same as what I done. It's easy to criticize,"  I says, "but you ain't got the same problems as what I got." '  'Ah,' said the other, 'that's jest it.
 That's jest where it is.
 But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal.
 The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a street like this.
 Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had definite business there.
 The patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them.
 'May I see your papers, comrade?
 What are you doing here?
 What time did you leave work?
 Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it.
 A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped  a young woman apron round a tiny child playing in a puddle, and leapt back again, all in one movement.
 At the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to the sky.
 The proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind.
 They seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound.
 When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window.
  He walked on.
 A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below  a black plume a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins.
 There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the middle of a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him he could see a bright red streak.
 When he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist.
  He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned down a side-street to the right.
 Within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened.
 It was nearly twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ('pubs', the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ('pubs' called the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ('pubs') were choked with customers.
 From their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust, and sour beer.
 In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men were standing very close together, the middle one of three men holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over the middle one shoulder.
 Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces, Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies.
 It was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading.
 He was a few paces away from the group when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation.
 For a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows.
 I tell you no number ending in seven ain't won for over fourteen months!
'  'No, it 'as not!
 Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper.
 I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock.
 An' I tell you, no number ending in seven----'  'Yes, a seven 'AS won!
 I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.
 It were in February--second week in February.
 I got it all down in black and white.
 An' I tell you, no number----'  'Oh, pack no number----'   in!
' said the third man.
  They were talking about the Lottery.
 Winston looked back when  winston had gone thirty metres.
 They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.
 It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive.
 It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant.
 Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory.
 Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but  winston was aware (indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.
 In the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.
 You had to cling on to that.
 When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith.
 The street into which he had turned ran downhill.
 He had a feeling that he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away.
 The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers were selling tired-looking vegetables.
 At this moment Winston remembered where winston was.
 The alley led out into the main street, and down the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where  the alley had bought the blank book which was now  the alley diary.
 A very old man, bent but active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn, pushed open the swing door and went in.
 As Winston stood watching, it occurred to winston that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged when the Revolution happened.
 He and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism.
 In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the Revolution.
 If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a prole.
 Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold of him.
 He would say to him: 'Tell me about your life when you were a boy.
 What was it like in those days?
 Were things better than things are now, or were things worse?
 It was madness of course.
 As usual, there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed.
 If the patrols appeared   might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not likely that the patrols would believe  .
 Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls.
 A game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted the room for perhaps as much as thirty seconds.
 The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young man with enormous forearms.
  'I arst you civil enough, didn't I?
 'You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the 'ole bleeding boozer?
 There's the glasses on the shelf in front of you.
 We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.
'  'When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,' said the barman, with a glance at the other customers.
  There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry seemed to disappear.
 The old man's white-stubbled face had flushed pink.
 He turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston.
  'You're a gent,' said the other, straightening a gent shoulders again.
 He appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls.
 Beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs.
 The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in practice  the proles could get hold of it easily enough.
 The game of darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets.
 Winston's presence was forgotten for a moment.
 There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard.
 It was horribly dangerous, but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in.
  ''E could 'a drawed me off a pint,' grumbled the old man as the old man settled down behind a glass.
 And a 'ole litre's too much.
'  'You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,' said Winston tentatively.
  The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and from the bar to the door of the Gents, as though   the old man's pale blue eyes were in the bar-room that he expected the changes to have occurred.
  'The beer was better,' he said finally.
 When I was a young man, mild beer--wallop we used to call it--was fourpence a pint.
  'It's all wars,' said the old man vaguely.
 He took up his glass, and his shoulders straightened again.
 Winston went to the bar and came back with two more half-litres.
 The old man appeared to have forgotten  the old man prejudice against drinking a full litre.
 'You must have been a grown man before I was born.
 You can remember what it was like in the old days, before the Revolution.
 We can only read about them in books, and what it says in the books may not be true.
 There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty worse than anything we can imagine.
 Here in London, the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death.
 They worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room.
 And at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands--the capitalists, they were called--who were rich and powerful.
 They owned everything that there was to own.
 'Funny you should mention 'em.
 I was jest thinking, I ain't seen a top 'at in years.
 Gorn right out, they 'ave.
 The last time I wore one was at my sister-in-law's funeral.
 And that was--well, I couldn't give you the date, but the date must'a been fifty years ago.
 Of course it was only 'ired for the occasion, you understand.
 'The point is, these capitalists--these capitalists and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on priests--were the lords of the earth.
 You--the ordinary people, the workers--were their slaves.
 They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-nine tails.
 You had to take your cap off when you passed your cap.
 'Now there's a word I ain't 'eard since ever so long.
 And there was one bloke--well, I couldn't give you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'e was.
 'E didn't 'alf give it 'em!
 Of course 'e was referring to the Labour Party, you understand.
  'What I really wanted to know was this,' he said.
 'Do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days?
 In the old days, the rich people, the people at the top----'  'The 'Ouse of Lords,' put in the old man reminiscently.
 What I am asking is, were these people able to treat you as an inferior, simply because these people able to treat you as an inferior were rich and you were poor?
 Is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them "Sir"  and take off your cap when you passed them?
  'Yes,' he said.
 I didn't agree with it, myself, but I done it often enough.
 Had to, as you might say.
 'I recollect it as if it was yesterday.
 It was Boat Race night--terribly rowdy they used to get on Boat Race night--and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue.
 'E was kind of zig-zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into 'im accidental-like.
 I say, "Ju think you've bought the bleeding pavement?"  'E says, "I'll twist your bloody 'ead off if you get fresh with me."  I says, "You're drunk. I'll give you in charge in 'alf a minute,"  I says.
 An' if you'll believe me, 'e puts 'is 'and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus.
 Well, I was young in them days, and I was going to 'ave fetched 'im one, only----'  A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston.
 The old man's memory was nothing but a rubbish-heap of details.
 One could question him all day without getting any real information.
 The party histories might still be true, after a fashion:  the party histories might even be completely true.
  'Perhaps I have not made myself clear,' he said.
 'What I'm trying to say is this.
 You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life before the Revolution.
 In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up.
 Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than it is now, or worse?
 When he spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.
  'I know what you expect me to say,' he said.
 'You expect me to say as I'd sooner be young again.
 Most people'd say  most'd sooner be young, if you arst 'em.
 You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young.
 When you get to my time of life you ain't never well.
 I suffer something wicked from my feet, and my bladder's jest terrible.
 Six and seven times a night it 'as me out of bed.
 On the other 'and, there's great advantages in being a old man.
 You ain't got the same worries.
 No truck with women, and that's a great thing.
 I ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'd credit it.
'  Winston sat back against the window-sill.
 It was no use going on.
 He was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room.
 The extra half-litre was already working on him.
 Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at  winston empty glass, and hardly noticed when  winston feet carried  winston out into the street again.
 Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question, 'Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?
 But in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another.
 They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant facts were outside the range of all the relevant facts vision.
 They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones.
 And when memory failed and written records were falsified--when that happened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.
 He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed among dwelling-houses.
 Immediately above  immediately head there hung three discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded.
 He seemed to know the place.
 Of course!
 He was standing outside the junk-shop where he had bought the diary.
  A twinge of fear went through him.
 It had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the place again.
 And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet had brought him back here of their own accord.
 It was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary.
 At the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open.
 With the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, he stepped through the doorway.
 He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles.
 His spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or perhaps a musician.
 His voice was soft, as though faded, and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles.
  'I recognized you on the pavement,' he said immediately.
 'You're the gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album.
 Cream-laid, it used to be called.
 There's been no paper like that made for--oh, I dare say fifty years.
' He peered at Winston over the top of his spectacles.
 Or did you just want to look round?
'  'I was passing,' said Winston vaguely.
' He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand.
 'You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say.
 Between you and me, the antique trade's just about finished.
 Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees.
 I haven't seen a brass candlestick in years.
 In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish.
 Only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends--lacquered snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like--which looked as though they might include something interesting.
 As Winston wandered towards the table winston eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight, and winston picked his eye up.
  It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making almost a hemisphere.
 At the heart of it, magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone.
  'What is it?
' said Winston, fascinated.
  'That's coral, that is,' said the old man.
 They used to kind of embed it in the glass.
 That wasn't made less than a hundred years ago.
 More, by the look of it.
'  'It's a beautiful thing,' said Winston.
  'It is a beautiful thing,' said the other appreciatively.
 I can remember when a thing like that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was--well, I can't work eight pounds out, but eight pounds was a lot of money.
 But who cares about genuine antiques nowadays--even the few that's left?
 What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one.
 The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen.
 The thing was doubly attractive because of  the thing apparent uselessness, though he could guess that  the thing must once have been intended as a paperweight.
 It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge.
 It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a Party member to have in his possession.
 The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars.
  'There's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,' he said.
 'There's not much in it.
 We'll do with a light if we're going upstairs.
'  He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney-pots.
 Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in.
 An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece.
 Under the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still on the mattress.
  'We lived here till my wife died,' said the old man half apologetically.
 Now that's a beautiful mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it.
 But I dare say you'd find it a little bit cumbersome.
'  He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting.
 The thought flitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk.
 It was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in thought a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral memory.
 It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.
' he could not help murmuring.
  'Ah,' said the old man, 'I never had one of those things.
 And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow.
 Now that's a nice gateleg table in the corner there.
 Though of course you'd have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.
 It was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960.
 The old man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed.
  'Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all----' all----' began delicately.
 It was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front.
 It seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.
 'It's a ruin now.
 It's in the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.
 It was bombed in--oh, many years ago.
 It was a church at one time, St Clement Danes, st clement danes name was.
' He smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and added: 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!
' said Winston.
 How it goes on I don't remember, but I do know it ended up, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a chopper to chop off your head."  It was a kind of a dance.
 They held out their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to "Here comes a chopper to chop off your head"  they brought their arms down and caught you.
 It was just names of churches.
 All the London churches were in it--all the principal ones, that is.
'  Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged.
 It was always difficult to determine the age of a London building.
 Anything large and impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle Ages.
 One could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books.
  'I never knew it had been a church,' he said.
  'There's a lot of them left, really,' said the old man, 'though they've been put to other uses.
   there, now, that's as far as I can get.
' said Winston.
 It's in Victory Square, alongside the picture gallery.
 It was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds--scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.
  'St Martin's-in-the-Fields it used to be called,' supplemented the old man, 'though I don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.
'  Winston did not buy the picture.
 It would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken out of its frame.
 But he lingered for some minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not Weeks--as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shop-front--but Charrington.
 Mr Charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years.
 Throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never quite got to the point of doing it.
 All the while that they were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head.
 Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's!
 It was curious, but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten.
 From one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth.
 Yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing.
  He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not to let the old man see the old man reconnoitring the street before stepping out of the door.
 He had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval--a month, say--he would take the risk of visiting the shop again.
 It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre.
 He would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish.
 He would buy the engraving of St Clement Danes, take the engraving of st clement danes out of the engraving of st clement danes frame, and carry the engraving of st clement danes home concealed under the jacket of his overalls.
 He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington's memory.
 Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through  even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs mind again.
 For perhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window.
 He had even started humming to an improvised tune     Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,   You owe me three farthings, say the----   Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water.
 It was the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair.
 She looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him.
  For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move.
 Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction.
 She must have followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived.
 It was too great a coincidence.
 It was enough that she was watching him.
 Probably she had seen him go into the pub as well.
  It was an effort to walk.
 The lump of glass in  the lump pocket banged against  the lump thigh at each step, and  the lump was half minded to take it out and throw it away.
  The street was a blind alley.
 Winston halted, stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace  winston steps.
 As   turned   occurred to   that the girl had only passed   three minutes ago and that by running   could probably catch up with the girl.
 He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone.
 The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job.
 But he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable.
 Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself.
 He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening.
 A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him.
 All he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet.
  It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat.
 Then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer.
 He sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.
  It was at night that they came for you, always at night.
 The proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you.
 Undoubtedly some people did so.
 He thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed.
 He might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act.
 It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one's own body.
 Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible.
 On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until the body fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.
 It was important to write something down.
 Her voice seemed to stick into  her voice brain like jagged splinters of glass.
 He tried to think of O'Brien, for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him away.
 It would not matter if they killed you at once.
 To be killed was what you expected.
  Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same?
 Why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life?
 When once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead.
 Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time?
  He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of O'Brien.
 'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' O'Brien had said to o'brien.
 But with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further.
 Half the tobacco promptly fell out on to  half tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again.
 The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that of O'Brien.
 Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at a coin.
 The face gazed up at  the face, heavy, calm, protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?
 Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:     WAR IS PEACE   FREEDOM IS SLAVERY   IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH      PART TWO     Chapter 1    It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory.
  A solitary figure was coming towards   a solitary figure from the other end of the long, brightly-lit corridor.
 It was the girl with dark hair.
 As   came nearer   saw that   right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as   overalls.
 Probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were 'roughed in'.
 It was a common accident in the Fiction Department.
  They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on the girl face.
 She must have fallen right on the injured arm.
 The girl had risen to  the girl knees.
 Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever.
  A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart.
 In front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone.
  'It's nothing.
 She had certainly turned very pale.
  'You haven't broken anything?
 She had regained some of her colour, and appeared very much better.
 'I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang.
 Thanks, comrade!
 The whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute.
 Not to let one's feelings appear in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened.
 Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand.
 There was no question that she had done it intentionally.
 It was something small and flat.
 It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.
 Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it.
 For a moment  for a moment was tempted to take  for a moment into one of the water-closets and read  for a moment at once.
 But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew.
 There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously.
 Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing close attention.
 So far as he could see there were two possibilities.
 One, much the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had feared.
 The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description.
 But there was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress it.
 This was, that the message did not come from the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground organization.
 Perhaps the girl was part of it!
 No doubt the idea was absurd, but the idea had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand.
 It was not till a couple of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to him.
 And even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably meant death--still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite.
  He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid the completed bundle of work into the pneumatic tube.
 He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of paper on top of it.
 On it was written, in a large unformed handwriting:  I LOVE YOU.
  For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole.
  For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work.
 What was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen.
 He had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week.
 He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of Big Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by his daughter's troop of Spies.
 The irritating thing was that in the racket of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated.
 She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not look in that direction again.
 Immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside.
 It consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under a cloud.
 This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for more than two hours winston succeeded in shutting the girl out of winston mind altogether.
 Then the memory of her face came back, and with the memory of her face a raging, intolerable desire to be alone.
 He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried off to the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a 'discussion group', played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled 'Ingsoc in relation to chess'.
 At the sight of the words I LOVE YOU the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid.
 It was not till twenty-three hours, when he was home and in bed--in the darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent--that he was able to think continuously.
  It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting.
 He knew that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note.
 Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well she might be.
 Nor did the idea of refusing  nor advances even cross his mind.
 Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, but that was of no importance.
 He had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly full of ice.
 What  what feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if  what did not get in touch with her quickly.
 It was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated.
  Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated.
 If   had worked in the Records Department   might have been comparatively simple, but   had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the Fiction Department lay, and   had no pretext for going there.
 If   had known where   lived, and at what time   left work,   could have contrived to meet   somewhere on   way home; but to try to follow   home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry, which was bound to be noticed.
 As for sending a letter through the mails, it was out of the question.
 Actually, few people ever wrote letters.
 For the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable.
 If   could get   at a table by  , somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round--if these conditions endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few words.
  For a week after this, life was like a restless dream.
 On the next day  on the next day did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having already blown.
 On the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen.
 Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all.
 His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an agony.
 If there was any relief, it was in   work, in which   could sometimes forget   for ten minutes at a stretch.
 He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her.
 There was no enquiry he could make.
 Her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist.
 The relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds.
 It was early, and the place was not very full.
 The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that someone in front had not received someone in front tablet of saccharine.
 She was perhaps three metres away from him.
 It was no use.
 It was not safe to refuse.
 After having been recognized,   could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl.
 It was too noticeable.
 Winston had a hallucination of  winston smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it.
 Surely enough, she was at a table in about the same place, and again alone.
 The person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes.
 It was no use unless he could get the girl alone.
 At this moment there was a tremendous crash.
 But it was all right.
  He did not look at her.
 A week had gone by since she had first approached him.
 It was impossible that this affair should end successfully; such things did not happen in real life.
  'What time do you leave work?
 Don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people.
 They did not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another.
  Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time.
 He wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which Big Brother's statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, the eurasian aeroplanes ( had been, a few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One.
 In the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell.
 At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared.
 It was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated.
 But at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left.
 Soon he was within arm's length of the girl, but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh.
 They were shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.
 Her cheek was almost near enough for  her cheek to feel  her cheek warmth.
 She began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks.
  'Can you hear me?
 You'll have to remember this.
 'Can you remember all that?
 You may have to wait.
 I'll get there by another way.
'  'Then get away from me as quick as you can.
'  She need not have told him that.
 But for the moment they could not extricate themselves from the crowd.
 At the start there had been a few boos and hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and had soon stopped.
 The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity.
 Foreigners, whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal.
 One literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them.
 In the last truck  in the last truck could see an aged man,  in the last truck face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists crossed in front of  in the last truck, as though  in the last truck were used to having them bound together.
 To turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly.
 With hands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies, the press stared steadily in front of the press, and instead of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston out of nests of hair.
 Under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells.
 It was the second of May.
  He was a bit early.
 There had been no difficulties about the journey, and the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been.
 In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in London.
 There were no telescreens, of course, but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting attention.
 For distances of less than 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who examined the papers of any Party member they found there and asked awkward questions.
 However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being followed.
 The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because of the summery weather.
 The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was filled to overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from a toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon with 'in-laws' in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston, to get hold of a little black-market butter.
 It was the best thing to do.
 It was the girl.
 Obviously she had been that way before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit.
 Winston followed, still clasping  winston bunch of flowers.
 His first feeling was relief, but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of scarlet hips, the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him.
 The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted him.
 Already on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of London in the pores of his skin.
 They came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of.
 There's always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice.
 We're all right here.
'  He still had not the courage to approach her.
 'We're all right here?
' They were small ashes, which at some time had been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles, none of them thicker than one's wrist.
 Besides, I've been here before.
'  They were only making conversation.
 They seemed to have fallen of their own accord.
' They were brown, he noted, a rather light shade of brown, with dark lashes.
 I've got a wife that I can't get rid of.
 I've got varicose veins.
 I've got five false teeth.
  The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in whose act arms.
 At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity.
 The youthful body was strained against  the youthful body own, the mass of dark hair was against  the youthful body face, and yes!
 But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere contact.
 All he felt was incredulity and pride.
 He was glad that this was happening, but he had no physical desire.
 It was too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without women--he did not know the reason.
 The girl picked  the girl up and pulled a bluebell out of  the girl hair.
 We've got the whole afternoon.
 If anyone was coming you could hear anyone a hundred metres away.
'  'What is your name?
 I know yours.
 It was even a sort of love-offering to start off by telling the worst.
  'I hated the sight of you,' he said.
'  'Yes, something of that kind.
'  'It's this bloody thing that does it,' she said, ripping off the scarlet sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging the scarlet sash of the junior anti-sex league on to a bough.
 Then, as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate.
 It was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper.
 Chocolate normally was dull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, like the smoke of a rubbish fire.
 I was a troop-leader in the Spies.
'  'It was something in your face.
 A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language.
 Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom did swear, aloud, at any rate.
 It was merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all the party ways, and somehow the party seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay.
 We're all right if we keep behind the boughs.
  'That's right, there is a stream.
 It's at the edge of the next field, actually.
 It was in the sun, they in the shade.
 Sometimes  sometimes stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled  sometimes wings, then swelled  sometimes speckled breast and again burst into song.
 He wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near.
 Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small, beetle-like man was listening intently--listening to that.
 But by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind.
 The girl's waist in the bend of  the girl's waist arm was soft and warm.
 Wherever  wherever hands moved it was all as yielding as water.
 The bird took fright and fled with a clatter of wings.
 When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him.
 it was almost as in his dream.
'  'Of course.
 But there's plenty that WOULD if they got half a chance.
 They're not so holy as they make out.
 Anything that hinted at corruption always filled  anything that hinted at corruption with a wild hope.
 Not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces.
 Presently the rising and falling of  presently breasts slowed to normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness  presently fell apart.
 But the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back.
 It was a blow struck against the Party.
 It was a political act.
 It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy.
 If   judged that the coast was clear   would blow   nose when   approached; otherwise   was to walk past   without recognition.
 That was in another hiding-place known to Julia, the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier.
 She was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips.
 Even her lips were white.
 She was dead!
 But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips.
 Winston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer, and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide.
  Julia was twenty-six years old.
 But she was not interested in the finished product.
 Any kind of organized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure, struck her as stupid.
 The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same.
 It was too remote to be worth thinking about.
 It was hopeless even as a daydream.
  'What was she like, your wife?
 Meaning naturally orthodox, incapable of thinking a bad thought?
 Sex talks once a month for the over-sixteens.
 Unlike Winston,   had grasped the inner meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism.
'  That was very true, that thought.
 It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.
  Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine.
 To be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrong-doing.
 But at this moment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath some tufts of loosestrife.
 One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on the same root.
  'Look, Katharine!
 There was not a human creature anywhere, not a leaf stirring, not even a bird awake.
 The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his face.
 In this game that we're playing, we can't win.
 So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the same thing.
  'Then stop talking about dying.
 And now listen, dear, we've got to fix up about the next time we meet.
 Beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster.
 The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece.
 The clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteen-twenty really.
 Actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table.
 Everyone wanted a place where  everyone could be alone occasionally.
 The June sun was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle, was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line, pegging out a series of square white things which Winston recognized as babies' diapers.
 Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contralto:     It was only an 'opeless fancy.
   The tune had been haunting London for weeks past.
 The words of these songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator.
 But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound.
 But the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors and near at hand, had been too much for both of them.
 For some time after their visit to the church belfry the church belfry had been impossible to arrange meetings.
 Finally both of both managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day.
  At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs.
 And here's a loaf of bread--proper white bread, not our bloody stuff--and a little pot of jam.
 'But listen, dear.
 Down in the yard the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and the line.
 Her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged with a sort of happy melancholy.
 The transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that.
 Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make the eyes brighter.
 The improvement in her appearance was startling.
 Winston had occasionally slept in one in  winston boyhood: Julia had never been in one before, so far as julia could remember.
 Most of her make-up had transferred  most of her make-up to  most of her make-up own face or the bolster, but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone.
 A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast.
 Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street.
 In some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for two minutes.
'  'Don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here.
 With one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other, Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping julia down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement.
 'What is this place?
' The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington had taught mr charrington came back into mr charrington head, and mr charrington added half-nostalgically: "Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!"
 But there must be another line after 'the bells of Old Bailey'.
 He used to say it to me when I was a little girl.
 The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself.
 The paperweight was the room  the paperweight was in, and the coral was Julia's life and  the paperweight own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.
 Processions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays, film shows, telescreen programmes all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs faked.
 Julia's unit in the Fiction Department had been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets.
 Late at night, when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air.
 The proles had taken a fancy to  the proles, and in the midnight streets  the proles competed with the still-popular ' the proles was only a hopeless fancy'.
 Squads of volunteers, organized by Parsons, were preparing the street for Hate Week, stitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, and perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers.
 The heat and the manual work had even given the manual work a pretext for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings.
 The thing had been plastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother.
 There were further angry demonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction house set on fire and perished of suffocation.
 The rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat.
 The process of life had ceased to be intolerable,  the process of life had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of  the process of life voice.
 The old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other hand to have almost no customers.
 To talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box.
 There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death of poor Cock Robin.
 'It just occurred to me you might be interested,'   would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever   produced a new fragment.
  Both of   both knew--in a way, it was never out of   both minds that what was now happening could not last long.
 There were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul grasping at a damned soul last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking.
 But there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence.
 It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside it time could be arrested.
 Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives.
 Even the one plan that was practicable, suicide, they had no intention of carrying out.
 To hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available.
  Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the Party, but with no notion of how to take the first step.
 Curiously enough, this did not strike  curiously enough as an impossibly rash thing to do.
 When public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals 'Death to the traitors!
 Such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible.
 It would always exist, and it would always be the same.
 This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him.
 Often   was ready to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to  .
 But the issue still struck her as unimportant.
 Such things did not appear to horrify her.
  'Were they friends of yours?
'  'Then what was there to worry about?
 And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute.
 I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself.
' said Julia.
 But one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there--small groups of people banding small groups of people together, and gradually growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off.
 Whenever he began to talk of the principles of Ingsoc, doublethink, the mutability of the past, and the denial of objective reality, and to use Newspeak words, newspeak became bored and confused and said that newspeak never paid any attention to that kind of thing.
 If   persisted in talking of such subjects,   had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep.
 Talking to  talking,  talking realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant.
 In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed the party most successfully on people incapable of understanding it.
 They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because no harm left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird.
 He began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members.
 His name has slipped my memory for the moment.
 By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime  by sharing a small act of thoughtcrime had turned the two of the two into accomplices.
 They had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor, but now O'Brien halted.
 Then he went on:  'What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed you had used two words which have become obsolete.
 It might interest you to look at it, perhaps?
 Perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you?
  'I am usually at home in the evenings,' he said.
 Nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a mass of other papers.
  They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most.
 It had been contrived as a way of letting Winston know O'Brien's address.
 This was necessary, because except by direct enquiry  this was never possible to discover where anyone lived.
 'If you ever want to see me, this is where I can be found,' was what O'Brien had been saying to o'brien.
 The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second had been the opening of the diary.
 He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.
 There was the dream itself, and there was a memory connected with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking.
 It had all occurred inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances.
 The dream had also been comprehended by--indeed, in some sense  the dream had consisted in--a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the news film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopter blew them both to pieces.
  'Do you know,' he said, 'that until this moment I believed I had murdered my mother?
' said Julia, almost asleep.
 It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his consciousness over many years.
 He was not certain of the date, but he could not have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had happened.
 He remembered better the rackety, uneasy circumstances of the time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube stations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour, the enormous queues outside the bakeries, the intermittent machine-gun fire in the distance--above all, the fact that there was never enough to eat.
 He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted over the bad patches in the road, sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.
 It was evident even to Winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen.
 She did everything that was needed--cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted the mantelpiece--always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an artist's lay-figure moving of an artist's lay-figure moving own accord.
 Her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness.
 He would ask his mother naggingly, over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm at his mother (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share.
 She took it for granted that he, 'the boy', should have the biggest portion; but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more.
 He knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; he even felt that he had a right to do it.
 The clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him.
 Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf.
 He remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate.
 It was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts.
 Suddenly, as though he were listening to somebody else, Winston heard winston demanding in a loud booming voice that winston should be given the whole piece.
 His mother told him not to be greedy.
 The little girl took hold of it and looked at hold of it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was.
 Then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's hand and was fleeing for the door.
  'Winston, Winston!
 His mother's anxious eyes were fixed on his face.
 Even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening.
 Something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying.
 After   had devoured the chocolate   felt somewhat ashamed of   and hung about in the streets for several hours, until hunger drove   home.
 It was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp.
 As for   sister, his sister might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of the colonies for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which had grown up as a result of the civil war, or his sister might have been sent to the labour camp along with   mother, or simply left somewhere or other to die.
  The dream was still vivid in   the dream mind, especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which   the dream whole meaning seemed to be contained.
  He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance.
 But the real point of the story----'  From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again.
 He did not suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones.
 If you loved someone, you loved someone, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave someone love.
 When the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in his mother arms.
 It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to do it.
 The refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with  the refugee woman in the boat arm, which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper.
 When once you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference.
 Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again.
 And yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed all-important, because the people of only two generations ago were not attempting to alter history.
 The proles, it suddenly occurred to  the proles, had remained in this condition.
 For the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of the proles merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world.
 They had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort.
 And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked a severed hand lying on the pavement into the gutter as though a severed hand lying on the pavement had been a cabbage-stalk.
 'Has it ever occurred to you,'  ' said, 'that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before it's too late, and never see each other again?
 But I'm not going to do it, all the same.
 You look normal and innocent.
 I've thought it all out.
 What you do, I'm going to do.
'  'We may be together for another six months--a year--there's no knowing.
 At the end we're certain to be apart.
 If I confess, they'll shoot you, and if I refuse to confess, they'll shoot you just the same.
 We shall be utterly without power of any kind.
 The one thing that matters is that we shouldn't betray one another, although even that can't make the slightest difference.
 'They can't do that,' she said finally.
 'It's the one thing they can't do.
 They can make you say anything--ANYTHING--but they can't make you believe it.
 They can't get inside you.
 They can't get inside you.
 If you can FEEL that staying human is worth while, even when   can't have any result whatever, you've beaten them.
 Perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands.
 One did not know what happened inside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible to guess: tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning.
 But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did the object ultimately make?
 They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to.
 They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.
  The room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit.
 The telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet.
 At the far end of the room O'Brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of papers on either side of him.
  Winston's heart was thumping so hard that   winston's doubted whether   winston's would be able to speak.
 They had done it, they had done it at last, was all he could think.
 It had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer folly to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on O'Brien's doorstep.
 But merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the nerve.
 It was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling-places of the Inner Party, or even penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived.
 The whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of everything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro--everything was intimidating.
 Although   had a good pretext for coming here,   was haunted at every step by the fear that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner, demand   papers, and order   to get out.
 O'Brien's servant, however, had admitted the two of the two without demur.
 He was a small, dark-haired man in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless face which might have been that of a Chinese.
 The passage down which he led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white wainscoting, all exquisitely clean.
 For perhaps twenty seconds  for perhaps twenty seconds sat without stirring.
 Then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries:  'Items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery overheads stop end message.
 It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake.
 He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impossible to explain.
 His solid form towered over the pair of them, and the expression on his face was still indecipherable.
 He was waiting, somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what?
 Even now it was quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted.
 With difficulty Winston continued to keep winston eyes fixed on O'Brien's.
  'Shall I say it, or will you?
  'I will say it,' said Winston promptly.
'  'We have come here because----'  He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives.
 Since   did not in fact know what kind of help   expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say why   had come here.
 He went on, conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious:  'We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some kind of secret organization working against the Party, and that you are involved in it.
'  He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the door had opened.
  'Martin is one of us,' said O'Brien impassively.
 Put them on the round table.
 Then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort.
 Winston regarded  winston out of the corner of  winston eye.
 It struck him that the man's whole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment.
 Seen from the top the stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter the stuff gleamed like a ruby.
  'It is called wine,' said O'Brien with a faint smile.
 'You will have read about it in books, no doubt.
' His face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: 'I think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health.
 For some reason he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect.
  'Then there is such a person as Goldstein?
  'Yes, there is such a person, and such a person is alive.
 It is not simply an invention of the Thought Police?
 You will never learn much more about the Brotherhood than that the brotherhood exists and that you belong to the brotherhood.
 You ought not to have come here together, and you will have to leave separately.
 We have about twenty minutes at our disposal.
'  'Anything that we are capable of,' said Winston.
 He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take it for granted that Winston could speak for julia.
 He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers were known to him already.
'  'You are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one another again?
  It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before winston answered.
 For a moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech.
'  He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat more expression in it:  'Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different person?
'  Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin's Mongolian face.
 Julia had turned a shade paler, so that  julia freckles were showing, but  julia faced O'Brien boldly.
 She murmured something that seemed to be assent.
  'You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin,' martin said.
'  Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyes flickered over their faces.
 It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of changing a synthetic face expression.
 Later I shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which we shall destroy it.
 When you have read the book, you will be full members of the Brotherhood.
 But between the general aims that we are fighting for and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything.
 I tell you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether the brotherhood numbers a hundred members, or ten million.
 From your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that  from your personal knowledge numbers even as many as a dozen.
 You will have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear.
 As this was your first contact,   will be preserved.
 When you receive orders, orders will come from me.
 If we find   necessary to communicate with you,   will be through Martin.
 When you are finally caught, you will confess.
 But you will have very little to confess, other than your own actions.
 Probably you will not even betray me.
 By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become a different person, with a different face.
 It came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipulated a cigarette.
 More even than of strength, strength gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony.
 However much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic.
 'This is unavoidable,'  ' voice seemed to say; 'this is what we have got to do, unflinchingly.
 But this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again.
 When you looked at O'Brien's powerful shoulders and o'brien blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to believe that o'brien could be defeated.
 She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently.
 You have imagined, probably, a huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand.
 The members of the Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others.
 Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would lead them to a complete list.
 The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because  the brotherhood is not an organization in the ordinary sense.
 You will never have anything to sustain you, except the idea.
 When finally you are caught, you will get no help.
 At most, when it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell.
 You will work for a while, you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die.
 Those are the only results that you will ever see.
 But how far away that future may be, there is no knowing.
 It might be a thousand years.
  'What shall it be this time?
' he said, still with the same faint suggestion of irony.
  'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.
  They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood up to go.
 It was important, he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very observant.
 He took another pace or two up and down, then stopped.
 'I assume that you have a hiding-place of some kind?
 Meanwhile I shall send you a copy of THE BOOK'--even O'Brien, Winston noticed, seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in italics--'Goldstein's book, you understand, as soon as possible.
 It may be some days before I can get hold of one.
 There are not many in existence, as you can imagine.
 The Thought Police hunt  the thought police down and destroy  the thought police almost as fast as we can produce  the thought police.
 If the last copy were gone, we could reproduce the last copy almost word for word.
 One day in the fairly near future--I cannot give a date--one of the messages among your morning's work will contain a misprinted word, and you will have to ask for a repeat.
 At some time during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the arm and say "I think you have dropped your brief-case."  The one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein's book.
  'There are a couple of minutes before you need go,' said O'Brien.
' he said hesitantly.
 'And in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave?
 There did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding generalities.
 Instead of anything directly connected with O'Brien or the Brotherhood, there came into o'brien mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where o'brien mother had spent his mother last days, and the little room over Mr Charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel engraving in the glass paperweight rosewood frame.
 With a sort of grave courtesy he completed the stanza:     'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,   You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,   When will you pay me?
'   'You knew the last line!
' said Winston.
 You had better let me give you one of these tablets.
 His powerful grip crushed the bones of Winston's palm.
 At the door Winston looked back, but O'Brien seemed already to be in process of putting winston out of mind.
 He was waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen.
 Beyond him Winston could see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers.
 Within thirty seconds, it occurred to o'brien, O'Brien would be back at o'brien interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party.
 He felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through the light.
 Now it was all over, and he had literally nothing to do, no Party work of any description, until tomorrow morning.
 Slowly, in mild afternoon sunshine,  slowly walked up a dingy street in the direction of Mr Charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with  slowly.
 Inside it was the book, which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened, nor even looked at.
  On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the booming of guns--after six days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to this climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got the crowd hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, the crowd would unquestionably have torn the crowd to pieces--at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania was not after all at war with Eurasia.
  There was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place.
 Merely it became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy.
 It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit.
 At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats.
 The banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong!
 Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them.
 But within two or three minutes it was all over.
 The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been changed.
  The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax.
 He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it.
 The orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to their posts, were hardly necessary.
  Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.
 Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs--all had to be rectified at lightning speed.
 The work was overwhelming, all the more so because the processes that  the work involved could not be called by their true names.
 Each time that Winston broke off for one of winston spells of sleep winston tried to leave winston desk clear of work, and each time that winston crawled back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, half-burying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so that the first job was always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give winston room to work.
 It was like struggling with some crushing physical task, something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish.
 In so far as   had time to remember it,   was not troubled by the fact that every word   murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke of   ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie.
 He was as anxious as anyone else in the Department that the forgery should be perfect.
 On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down.
 A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had been achieved.
 It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever happened.
 At twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the Ministry were free till tomorrow morning.
  With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above Mr Charrington's shop.
 He was tired, but not sleepy any longer.
 He opened the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee.
 He sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case.
 The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed through many hands.
 Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted the same pattern, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far the same pattern is pushed one way or the other.
 The sweet summer air played against his cheek.
 From somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children: in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock.
 Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the Bering Strait.
  In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years.
 War, however, is no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth century.
 This is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous.
 On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy, meritorious.
 Motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon.
  To understand the nature of the present war--for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war--one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive.
 None of the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination.
 Eurasia is protected by  eurasia vast land spaces, Oceania by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of  eurasia inhabitants.
 With the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death.
 In any case each of the three super-states is so vast that  in any case can obtain almost all the materials that  in any case needs within  in any case own boundaries.
 In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labour power.
 Between the frontiers of the super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of  between the frontiers of the super-states, there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth.
 It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions, and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly struggling.
 Portions of  portions are constantly changing hands, and  portions of it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment.
 But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour.
 The inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely.
 It should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas.
 The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congo and the northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and Eastasia is never stable; round the Pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored: but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and the territory which forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate.
 They add nothing to the wealth of the world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war.
 But if they did not exist, the structure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself, would not be essentially different.
  The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of DOUBLETHINK, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.
 The world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward.
 Science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing.
 This failed to happen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly regimented society.
 As a whole the world is more primitive today than the world was fifty years ago.
 If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations.
 And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process--by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute--the machine did raise the living standards of the average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.
  But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction--indeed, in some sense was the destruction--of a hierarchical society.
 It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which WEALTH, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while POWER remained in the hands of a small privileged caste.
 For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty; and when once human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty had done this, human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would sweep the privileged minority had no function away.
 In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.
 To return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution.
  The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour.
 War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.
 A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in  a floating fortress the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships.
 Ultimately  ultimately is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built.
 In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population.
 In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage.
 By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life.
 Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter--set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call 'the proles'.
 The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty.
 And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.
  War,   war will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accomplishes   war in a psychologically acceptable way.
 What is concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself.
 Even the humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but  even the humblest party member is also necessary that  even the humblest party member should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph.
 In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war.
 It does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly.
 All that is needed is that a state of war should exist.
 The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires of the party members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes.
 In his capacity as an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK.
 Meanwhile no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real, and that the war is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania the undisputed master of the entire world.
  All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith.
 It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon.
 The search for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet.
 In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist.
 The empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc.
 The fields are cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery.
 There are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve.
 In so far as scientific research still continues, this is  in so far as scientific research still subject matter.
 The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor, studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions, gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist, physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life.
 In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work.
 Some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more and more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship; others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth's centre.
 What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that all three powers present researches are likely to discover.
 Although the Party, according to the party habit, claims the invention for the invention, atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about ten years later.
 The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society, and hence of the ruling groups of all countries own power.
 Thereafter, although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped.
 All three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store atomic bombs up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later.
 And in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks, have never been repeated.
 When any large operation is undertaken, it is usually a surprise attack against an ally.
 The strategy that all three powers are following, or pretend to all three powers that all three powers are following, is the same.
 During this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally  during this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs will all be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible.
 It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack.
 This scheme, it is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization.
 This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the super-states are arbitrary.
 Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula.
 If Oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on the Oceanic level.
 War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia, and  war is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages.
  Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states are very much the same.
 In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc, in Eurasia  in oceania is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia  in oceania is called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps better rendered as Obliteration of the Self.
 The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but  the citizen of oceania is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense.
 Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare.
 It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so.
 Their lives are dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory.
 Meanwhile the fact that there IS no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and ingsoc rival systems of thought.
 Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed becoming continuous war character.
  In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat.
 So long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be serious.
 In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four.
 Inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions.
 Newspapers and history books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practised today would have been impossible.
 War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards.
  But when war becomes literally continuous, war also ceases to be dangerous.
 As we have seen, researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war, but researches that could be called scientific are essentially a kind of daydreaming, and researches that could be called scientific failure to show results is not important.
 Since each of the three super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised.
 Cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down.
 The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be.
 They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose.
  The war, therefore, if we judge   the war by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture.
 It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist.
 The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different.
 The effect would be much the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries.
 For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger.
 A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war.
 Solitude and safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek.
 It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order.
 The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.
 It was more than a week since they had seen one another.
  'I've got THE BOOK,' he said as they disentangled themselves.
 From below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones.
 There seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song.
 Julia had settled down on  julia side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep.
 Then you can explain it to me as you go.
 He propped the book against his knees and began reading:   Chapter I Ignorance is Strength  Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low.
 They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered.
 Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted the same pattern, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far the same pattern is pushed one way or the other   'Julia, are you awake?
 It's marvellous.
 The aim of the Low, when they have an aim--for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives--is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal.
 Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of the other groups, and the struggle begins over again.
 But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer.
 There then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life.
 This doctrine, of course, had always had  this doctrine adherents, but in the manner in which  this doctrine was now put forward there was a significant change.
 It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave.
 The Middle, so long as  the middle was struggling for power, had always made use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity.
 Now, however, the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long.
 In the past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown.
 Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages.
 But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned.
 The new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating UNfreedom and INequality.
 These new movements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tended to keep the old ones names and pay lip-service to the old ones ideology.
 The familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more, and then stop.
  The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century.
 The cyclical movement of history was now intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if  the cyclical movement of history was intelligible, then it was alterable.
 It was still true that men were not equal in men native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth.
 In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable.
 Inequality was the price of civilization.
 Even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for human beings to live at different social or economic levels.
 Therefore, from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power, human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be averted.
 In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it.
 The idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years.
 And this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change.
 But by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian.
 Every new political theory, by whatever name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation.
 And in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years--imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole populations--not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive.
 But they had been foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious.
 The new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians.
 As compared with their opposite numbers in past ages,  as compared with their opposite numbers in past ages were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what  as compared with their opposite numbers in past ages were doing and more intent on crushing opposition.
 The ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what  the ruling groups subjects were thinking.
 Even the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards.
 With the development of television, and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end.
 Every citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of communication closed.
 The possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for the first time.
  After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society regrouped society, as always, into High, Middle, and Low.
 But the new High group, unlike all the new high group forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard the new high group position.
 Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly.
 Collectively, the Party owns everything in Oceania, because the party controls everything, and disposes of the products as the party thinks fit.
 In the years following the Revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization.
 Factories, mines, land, houses, transport--everything had been taken away from them: and since these things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be public property.
 Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement and inherited the earlier socialist movement phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme; with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been made permanent.
 Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern.
 These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of  these causes are present in some degree.
  After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality disappeared.
 Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert.
 The masses never revolt of  the masses own accord, and  the masses never revolt merely because  the masses are oppressed.
 Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.
 As for the problem of over-production, which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare (see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch.
 From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able, under-employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks.
 It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it.
 Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful.
 Big Brother is the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit the party to the world.
 Below the Inner Party comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is described as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the hands.
 Admission to either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen.
 In no part of Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that the inhabitants are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital.
 Oceania has no capital, and  oceania titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows.
 It is true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines.
 There is far less to-and-fro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the pre-industrial age.
 Between the two branches of the Party there is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious members of the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing ambitious members of the outer party to rise.
 The most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent, are simply marked down by the Thought Police and eliminated.
 But this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is this state of affairs a matter of principle.
 It does not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat.
 The older kind of Socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called 'class privilege' assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent.
 The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living.
  All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the Party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from being perceived.
 From the proletarians nothing is to be feared.
 Left to  left,  left will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than the world is.
 What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference.
 In a Party member, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated.
 Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone.
 Wherever  wherever may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in  wherever bath or in bed,  wherever can be inspected without warning and without knowing that  wherever is being inspected.
 On the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour.
 Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely the wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future.
 If   is a person naturally orthodox (in Newspeak a GOODTHINKER),   will in all circumstances know, without taking thought, what is the true belief or the desirable emotion.
  A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm.
 He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party.
 The discontents produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline.
 The first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to young children, is called, in Newspeak, CRIMESTOP.
 CRIMESTOP means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought.
 It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if the simplest arguments are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction.
 Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible.
 But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts.
 But it means also the ability to BELIEVE that black is white, and more, to KNOW that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary.
 This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK.
 The subsidiary reason is that the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because the proletarian has no standards of comparison.
 He must be cut off from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising.
 But by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the Party.
 It is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in all cases right.
 It is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted.
 This day-to-day falsification of the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.
  The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc.
 And since the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of the party members, the party follows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it.
 For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version IS the past, and no different past can ever have existed.
 This holds good even when, as often happens, the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year.
 At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what the absolute is now.
 It will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory.
 To make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act.
 But it is also necessary to REMEMBER that events happened in the desired manner.
 And if it is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with written records, then it is necessary to FORGET that one has done so.
 It is learned by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox.
 In Newspeak  in newspeak is called DOUBLETHINK, though DOUBLETHINK comprises much else as well.
 The Party intellectual knows in which direction  the party intellectual memories must be altered;  the party intellectual therefore knows that  the party intellectual is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of DOUBLETHINK  the party intellectual also satisfies  the party intellectual that reality is not violated.
 The process has to be conscious, or  the process would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but  the process also has to be unconscious, or  the process would bring with  the process a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt.
 To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies--all this is indispensably necessary.
 For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of DOUBLETHINK one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth.
 Ultimately it is by means of DOUBLETHINK that the Party has been able--and may, for all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years--to arrest the course of history.
  All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because   all past oligarchies ossified or because   all past oligarchies grew soft.
 Either they became stupid and arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown; or they became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have used force, and once again were overthrown.
 If one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality.
 In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is.
 To these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over these people bodies like a tidal wave.
 They are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones.
 When it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening.
 It is in the ranks of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm is found.
 World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know  world-conquest to be impossible.
 This peculiar linking-together of opposites--knowledge with ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism--is one of the chief distinguishing marks of Oceanic society.
 It systematically undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty.
 The Ministry of Peace concerns  the ministry of peace with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.
 For it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely.
 It seemed to him that Julia had been very still for some time past.
 She was lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes.
 He shut the book, put the book carefully on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet over both of both.
  He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret.
 He understood HOW; he did not understand WHY.
 But after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad.
 He was safe, everything was all right.
 He lay dozing for a while; then the usual deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard below:     'It was only an 'opeless fancy,   It passed like an Ipril dye,   But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred   They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!
 The stove's gone out and the water's cold.
 I'm going to put my clothes on,' she added.
'  Winston also got up and dressed winston.
 The indefatigable voice sang on:     'They sye that time 'eals all things,   They sye you can always forget;   But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years   They twist my 'eart-strings yet!
 The sun must have gone down behind the houses;  the sun was not shining into the yard any longer.
 The flagstones were wet as though  the flagstones had just been washed, and  the flagstones had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh and pale was the blue between the chimney-pots.
 As   looked at the woman in the woman characteristic attitude, the woman thick arms reaching up for the line, the woman powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, her thick arms struck   for the first time that the woman was beautiful.
 It had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful.
  'She's a metre across the hips, easily,' said Julia.
  'That is her style of beauty,' said Winston.
 That was the one thing they could never do.
 Only by word of mouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret.
 It might easily be fifteen.
 She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken years.
 The mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots into interminable distance.
 Without having read to the end of THE BOOK, he knew that that must be Goldstein's final message.
 And could he be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party?
 Yes, because at the least it would be a world of sanity.
 Sooner or later it would happen, strength would change into consciousness.
 In the end their awakening would come.
 And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill.
  'Do you remember,' he said, 'the thrush that sang to us, that first day, at the edge of the wood?
'  'He wasn't singing to us,' said Julia.
 Not even that.
 All round the world, in London and New York, in Africa and Brazil, and in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villages of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and Japan--everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death and still singing.
 Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come.
 But you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four.
  'We are the dead,' echoed Julia dutifully.
 He could see the white all round the irises of Julia's eyes.
 The smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.
  'It was behind the picture,' breathed Julia.
  'It was behind the picture,' said the voice.
 They could do nothing except stand gazing into one another's eyes.
 To run for life, to get out of the house before it was too late--no such thought occurred to no such thought.
  'Now they can see us,' said Julia.
  'Now we can see you,' said the voice.
'  They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia's body shaking.
 Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own.
 There was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside.
 The yard seemed to be full of men.
  'The house is surrounded,' said Winston.
  'The house is surrounded,' said the voice.
  He heard Julia snap julia teeth together.
 And then another quite different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston had the impression of having heard before, struck in; 'And by the way, while we are on the subject, "Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head" !
 The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on solid men feet and truncheons in solid men hands.
 One thing alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give  one thing alone an excuse to hit you!
 The feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's face and body all exposed, was almost unbearable.
 The man protruded the tip of a white tongue, licked the place where  the man lips should have been, and then passed on.
 How small, thought Winston, how small   always was!
 One of the men had smashed  one of the men fist into Julia's solar plexus, doubling julia up like a pocket ruler.
 Winston dared not turn  winston head even by a millimetre, but sometimes her livid, gasping face came within the angle of  winston vision.
 He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe.
 Winston had a glimpse of  winston face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that was the last  winston saw of  winston.
 He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or three hours ago.
 He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one.
 Would not the light be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening?
 He wondered whether after all he and Julia had mistaken the time--had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty on the following morning.
 It was not interesting.
 Mr Charrington was still wearing  mr charrington old velvet jacket, but  mr charrington hair, which had been almost white, had turned black.
 Also he was not wearing his spectacles.
 He was still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer.
 His face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation.
 It was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty.
 It occurred to Winston that for the first time in winston life winston was looking, with knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police.
 Presumably  presumably was in the Ministry of Love, but there was no way of making certain.
 There were four telescreens, one in each wall.
 It had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away.
 But he was also hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger.
 It might be twenty-four hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six.
 He still did not know, probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him.
 Since   was arrested   had not been fed.
  He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed on his knee.
 It was even possible--he thought this because from time to time something seemed to tickle his leg--that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there.
 Hands out of pockets in the cells!
 Before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols.
 He did not know how long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to gauge the time.
 The majority of  the majority were common criminals, but there were a few political prisoners among  the majority.
 He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others.
 They yelled insults at the guards, fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene words on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when the telescreen tried to restore order.
 On the other hand some of some seemed to be on good terms with the guards, called some of them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spyhole in the door.
 There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent.
 They wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across Winston's lap, almost breaking winston thigh-bones.
' Then, noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off Winston's knees on to the bench.
 'I wouldn't 'a sat on you, only the buggers put me there.
 They dono 'ow to treat a lady, do they?
' She paused, patted her breast, and belched.
 'Pardon,' she said, 'I ain't meself, quite.
'  She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.
'  She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immediately to take a fancy to winston.
  'Smith,' said Winston.
 She was about the right age and physique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced-labour camp.
  No one else had spoken to him.
 To a surprising extent the ordinary criminals ignored the Party prisoners.
 The Party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to anybody, and above all of speaking to one another.
 Only once, when two Party members, both women, were pressed close together on the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedly-whispered words; and in particular a reference to something called 'room one-oh-one', which he did not understand.
  It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here.
 There were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped and his breath stopped.
 He felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth.
 He hardly thought of Julia.
 He could not fix his mind on her.
 He loved her and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the rules of arithmetic.
 O'Brien might know that  o'brien had been arrested.
 The Brotherhood,  the brotherhood had said, never tried to save  the brotherhood members.
 The blade would bite into  the blade with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone.
 Everything came back to  everything sick body, which shrank trembling from the smallest pain.
 He was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he got the chance.
 It was more natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it.
  Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell.
 It should have been easy, but he always lost count at some point or another.
 More often he wondered where he was, and what time of day it was.
 In this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out.
 In the Ministry of Love there were no windows.
 He moved himself mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.
 His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above the level of Winston's head.
 A scrubby beard covered  a scrubby beard face to the cheekbones, giving  a scrubby beard an air of ruffianism that went oddly with  a scrubby beard large weak frame and nervous movements.
  Winston roused   winston a little from   winston lethargy.
 His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.
 We were producing a definitive edition of the poems of Kipling.
 I could not help it!
 'It was impossible to change the line.
 Do you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to "rod"  in the entire language?
 A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy of the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the dirt and scrubby hair.
  'Has it ever occurred to you,' he said, 'that the whole history of English poetry has been determined by the fact that the English language lacks rhymes?
  'Do you know what time of day it is?
' His eyes flitted round the walls, as though he half expected to find a window somewhere.
 I do not see how one can calculate the time.
 Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one knee, then round the other.
  Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards,   ampleforth face vaguely perturbed, but uncomprehending.
 His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots.
 As the door opened, the wave of air that the door created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat.
 He began walking jerkily up and down, evidently unable to keep still.
 Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that they were trembling.
' said Winston.
 The tone of his voice implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be applied to himself.
 They don't shoot you if you haven't actually done anything--only thoughts, which you can't help?
 They'll know my record, won't they?
 YOU know what kind of chap I was.
 Not brainy, of course, but keen.
 I'll get off with five years, don't you think?
' said Winston.
' cried Parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen.
 'You don't think the Party would arrest an innocent man, do you?
 It can get hold of you without your even knowing it.
 Do you know how it got hold of me?
 Do you know what what heard me saying?
'  He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to utter an obscenity.
 Do you know what I'm going to say to what when I go up before the tribunal?
 "Thank you,"  I'm going to say, "thank you for saving me before it was too late." '  'Who denounced you?
' said Winston.
 I don't bear her any grudge for it.
 In fact I'm proud of her.
 It shows I brought her up in the right spirit, anyway.
 Then he suddenly ripped down his shorts.
 'I can't help it.
 It's the waiting.
 It then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards.
 More prisoners came and went, mysteriously.
 A time came when, if it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight.
 His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there.
 His pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone's eye.
 But what was startling was the emaciation of his face.
 Because of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the eyes seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or something.
  The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston.
 Winston did not look at  winston again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as vivid in  winston mind as though it had been straight in front of  winston eyes.
 Suddenly he realized what was the matter.
 The eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man, then turning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction.
 At last he stood up, waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the skull-faced man.
 His large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrollably.
 The force of it seemed almost to knock  the force clear of the floor.
 His body was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat.
 Then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees.
 Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the two halves of a dental plate fell out of a dental plate mouth.
  From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of a little blood overalls.
 His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever, as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliation.
 The man had actually flung  the man on  the man knees on the floor, with  the man hand clasped together.
 Haven't I told you everything already?
 Just tell me what it is and I'll confess straight off.
'  'Room 101,' said the officer.
  The man's face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston would not have believed possible.
 I don't care who it is or what you do to them.
'  'Room 101,' said the officer.
 Give me a chance and I'll tell you every word of a chance.
 'You didn't hear him!
 HE'S the one you want.
 But just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench.
 The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, but he clung on with astonishing strength.
 The howling stopped; the man had no breath left for anything except hanging on.
 Then there was a different kind of cry.
 A kick from a guard's boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands.
  'Room 101,' said the officer.
  The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing   the man crushed hand, all the fight had gone out of   the man.
 If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon.
 The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen.
 He would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet.
 Sometimes with a fading hope  sometimes thought of O'Brien and the razor blade.
 It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed.
 She might be screaming with pain at this moment.
 He thought: 'If I could save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it?
 In this place you could not feel anything, except pain and foreknowledge of pain.
 Besides, was it possible, when you were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase?
 The shock of the sight had driven all caution out of  the shock of the sight.
  'They got me a long time ago,' said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful irony.
  'You know this, Winston,' said O'Brien.
 All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard's hand.
 It might fall anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow----  The elbow!
 The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him.
 Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase of pain.
 Of pain you could wish only one thing: that  of pain should stop.
 Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain.
 In the face of pain there are no heroes, no heroes,  in the face of pain thought over and over as  in the face of pain writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at  in the face of pain disabled left arm.
     Chapter 2    He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move.
 Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face.
 At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic syringe.
 How long   had been down there   did not know.
 But whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds, there was no way of knowing.
 Later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected.
 The confession was a formality, though the torture was real.
 How many times he had been beaten, how long the beatings had continued, he could not remember.
 Always there were five or six men in black uniforms at  always simultaneously.
 There were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine.
 There were times when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness.
 There were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes.
 There were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: 'I will confess, but not yet.
 I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable.
 Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will tell them what they want.
' Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again.
 He remembered them dimly, because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor.
 He remembered a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee.
 His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted--he thought, he could not be sure--ten or twelve hours at a stretch.
 These other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that  these other questioners relied on.
 They slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning.
 Their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as from nervous fatigue.
 Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done.
 When his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears.
 He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was demanded of him.
 He confessed that he had murdered his wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife was still alive.
 He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known.
 Besides, in a sense it was all true.
 It was true that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.
 They stood out in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.
  He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes.
 The eyes grew larger and more luminous.
 Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed up.
  He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights.
 A man in a white coat was reading the dials.
  'Room 101,' said the officer.
  He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice.
 He was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it already.
 Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened.
 It was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when winston should have a respite, when winston should be fed, when winston should sleep, when the drugs should be pumped into winston arm.
 He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend.
 For seven years I have watched over you.
 I shall save you, I shall make you perfect.
' He was not sure whether it was O'Brien's voice; but it was the same voice that had said to him, 'We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' in that other dream, seven years ago.
 Even the back of his head was gripped in some manner.
  'I told you,' said O'Brien, 'that if we met again it would be here.
  Without any warning except a slight movement of O'Brien's hand, a wave of pain flooded his body.
 He did not know whether the thing was really happening, or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart.
 Although the pain had brought the sweat out on   forehead, the worst of all was the fear that   backbone was about to snap.
 He set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.
 Your especial fear is that it will be your backbone.
 That is what you are thinking, is it not, Winston?
 The wave of pain receded almost as quickly as  the wave had come.
 Will you please remember, throughout our conversation, that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree I choose?
 If you tell me any lies, or attempt to prevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level of intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly.
  O'Brien's manner became less severe.
 He resettled his spectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down.
  'I am taking trouble with you, Winston,' winston said, 'because you are worth trouble.
 You know perfectly well what is the matter with you.
 You are unable to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which never happened.
 Fortunately it is curable.
 Even now, I am well aware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression that your disease is a virtue.
 Now we will take an example.
 He opened his mouth to speak and then did not speak.
 You believed that three men, three one-time Party members named Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford--men who were executed for treachery and sabotage after making the fullest possible confession--were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with.
 It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed.
 But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it!
 It was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction.
 All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see the photograph.
 Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame.
'  'I do not remember it,' said O'Brien.
 How could one be sure that it was simple trickery?
 Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the thought that defeated him.
 More than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child.
 He not only did not know whether 'yes' or 'no' was the answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he believed to be the true one.
 Is there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still happening?
 We, the Party, control all records, and we control all memories.
 Then we control the past, do we not?
 That is what has brought you here.
 You would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity.
 You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one.
 Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston.
 You also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident.
 But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external.
 Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal.
 Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth.
 It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party.
 You must humble yourself before you can become sane.
  'Do you remember,' he went on, 'writing in your diary, "Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four" ?
  O'Brien held up   o'brien left hand,   o'brien back towards Winston, with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.
 The air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could not stop.
 This time the pain was only slightly eased.
 The fingers stood up before  the fingers eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four.
  'How many fingers, Winston?
'  'How many fingers, Winston?
'  'No, Winston, that is no use.
 How many fingers, please?
 Only stop it, stop the pain!
'  Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien's arm round his shoulders.
 He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably, his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks.
 For a moment he clung to O'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders.
 He had the feeling that O'Brien was his protector, that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source, and that it was O'Brien who would save him from it.
 It is not easy to become sane.
 O'Brien motioned with  o'brien head to the man in the white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings.
  'Again,' said O'Brien.
 The needle must be at seventy, seventy-five.
 He had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not.
 He opened his eyes.
 O'Brien had drawn back the lever.
 I suppose there are four.
 I would see five if I could.
'  'Really to see them.
 Winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening.
 Behind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again.
 He was trying to count them, he could not remember why.
 He knew only that it was impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four.
 When he opened his eyes his eyes was to find that he was still seeing the same thing.
'  'I don't know.
 I don't know.
 Four, five, six--in all honesty I don't know.
'  'Better,' said O'Brien.
 Almost in the same instant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body.
 The pain was already half-forgotten.
 He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien.
 At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over.
 If   could have moved   would have stretched out a hand and laid a hand on O'Brien's arm.
 He had never loved him so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain.
 The old feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back.
 Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.
 O'Brien had tortured  o'brien to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain,  o'brien would send  o'brien to  o'brien death.
 In some sense that went deeper than friendship,  in some sense that went deeper than friendship were intimates: somewhere or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place where  in some sense that went deeper than friendship could meet and talk.
 O'Brien was looking down at  o'brien with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in  o'brien own mind.
 When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.
  'I don't know.
'  'I don't know.
 Shall I tell you why we have brought you here?
'  He was bending over Winston.
 If   had been possible   would have cowered deeper into the bed.
 Then he continued less vehemently:  'The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no martyrdoms.
 You have read of the religious persecutions of the past.
 Later, in the twentieth century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called.
 And they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not make martyrs.
 Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity.
 They wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy.
 And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again.
 The dead men had become martyrs and  the dead men degradation was forgotten.
 In the first place, because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue.
 We do not make mistakes of that kind.
 Posterity will never hear of you.
 You will be lifted clean out from the stream of history.
 We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere.
 Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain.
 You will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future.
 O'Brien checked  o'brien step as though Winston had uttered the thought aloud.
 His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed.
  'You are thinking,' he said, 'that since we intend to destroy you utterly, so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference--in that case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first?
 That is what you were thinking, was it not?
 You are a stain that must be wiped out.
 We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul.
 We make him one of ourselves before we kill him.
 It is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless it may be.
 Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation.
 In the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his heresy, exulting in his heresy.
 But we make the brain perfect before we blow the brain out.
 No one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us.
 By the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men.
 It was touching to see how they loved him.
 They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die while their minds were still clean.
 He watched the heavy yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of his vision.
 There was no idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O'Brien had not long ago known, examined, and rejected.
 But in that case how could that case be true that O'Brien was mad?
 O'Brien halted and looked down at  o'brien.
  'Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completely you surrender to us.
 No one who has once gone astray is ever spared.
 And even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, still you would never escape from us.
 What happens to you here is for ever.
 We shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back.
 Things will happen to you from which you could not recover, if you lived a thousand years.
 We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.
 Winston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind  winston head.
 O'Brien had sat down beside the bed, so that  o'brien face was almost on a level with Winston's.
  'Three thousand,' he said, speaking over Winston's head to the man in the white coat.
 There was pain coming, a new kind of pain.
 Although   had already been lying on   back when the thing happened,   had a curious feeling that   had been knocked into that position.
 A terrific painless blow had flattened him out.
 As   eyes regained their focus   remembered who   was, and where   was, and recognized the face that was gazing into   own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of   brain.
 He also remembered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was at war with whom he did not know.
  'I don't remember.
 Since the beginning of your life, since the beginning of the Party, since the beginning of history, the war has continued without a break, always the same war.
 You pretended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent.
 You invented it, and later you grew to believe in it.
 You remember now the very moment at which you first invented it.
'  O'Brien held up the fingers of o'brien left hand, with the thumb concealed.
 Then everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment came crowding back again.
 It had faded but before O'Brien had dropped o'brien hand; but though o'brien could not recapture it, o'brien could remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of one's life when one was in effect a different person.
  'You see now,' said O'Brien, 'that it is at any rate possible.
  O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air.
 Over to his left Winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe.
  'Do you remember writing in your diary,' he said, 'that it did not matter whether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to?
 It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane.
 Before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions, if you choose.
 I have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly.
 All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her folly, her dirty-mindedness--everything has been burned out of her.
'  'You do not exist,' said O'Brien.
  Once again the sense of helplessness assailed helplessness.
 He knew, or he could imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were nonsense, they were only a play on words.
 But what use was it to say so?
 His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with which O'Brien would demolish o'brien.
  'I think I exist,' he said wearily.
 'I am conscious of my own identity.
'  'That, Winston, you will never know.
 If we choose to set you free when we have finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No.
 As long as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind.
 He had got to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter his tongue.
 He answered drily:  'You know what is in Room 101, Winston.
 'There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance.
 He could evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever.
 The whole process seemed to stretch out over a long, indefinite time--weeks, possibly--and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.
 And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question.
 Do you remember writing in your diary, "I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY" ?
'  'Is it true, what it says?
 They cannot.
 I do not have to tell you the reason: you know the reason already.
 Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.
'  He came closer to the bed.
 Go on, speak,' he added as Winston remained silent.
 That it sought power because men in the mass were frail, cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves.
 That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come, sacrificing the party own happiness to that of others.
 A thousand times better than Winston winston knew what the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept the mass of human beings there.
  'You are ruling over us for our own good,' he said feebly.
 'You believe that human beings are not fit to govern human beings, and therefore----'  He started and almost cried out.
 O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.
' he said.
 'You should know better than to say a thing like that.
 The Party seeks power entirely for  the party own sake.
 We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing.
 They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal.
 We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.
'  Winston was struck, as winston had been struck before, by the tiredness of O'Brien's face.
 It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired.
 O'Brien leaned over  o'brien, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer.
 You are thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body.
'  He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again, one hand in his pocket.
 It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means.
 The individual only has power in so far as  the individual ceases to be an individual.
 You know the Party slogan: "Freedom is Slavery" .
 Has   ever occurred to you that   is reversible?
 It must be so, because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all failures.
 But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he IS the Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal.
 The second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings.
 Over the body--but, above all, over the mind.
 Power over matter--external reality, as you would call it--is not important.
 'You don't even control the climate or the law of gravity.
 I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to.
 You must get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature.
 We make the laws of Nature.
 You are not even masters of this planet.
 And if we did not, what difference would it make?
 We can shut them out of existence.
 For millions of years the earth was uninhabited.
'  'Have you ever seen those bones, Winston?
 Of course not.
 Outside man there is nothing.
 We could reach them if we wanted to.
 Or we could blot them out.
 When we navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away.
 The stars can be near or distant, according as we need  the stars.
 Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that?
 The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind--surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false?
 Had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy?
  'I told you, Winston,' winston said, 'that metaphysics is not your strong point.
 The word you are trying to think of is solipsism.
 'By making him suffer,' he said.
 Unless   is suffering, how can you be sure that   is obeying your will and not   own?
 Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting pieces together again in new shapes of your own choosing.
 A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself.
 Everything else we shall destroy--everything.
 Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution.
 When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science.
 If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.
 O'Brien went on:  'And remember that it is for ever.
 This drama that I have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation, always in subtler forms.
 Always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible--and in the end utterly penitent, saved from the heretic, crawling to our feet of the heretic own accord.
 You are beginning, I can see, to realize what that world will be like.
 But in the end you will do more than understand it.
 You will accept it, welcome it, become part of it.
'  Winston had recovered winston sufficiently to speak.
 'You can't!
'  'You could not create such a world as you have just described.
'  'It would have no vitality.
 You are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love.
 Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster.
 Suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty.
  'I don't know--I don't care.
'  'We control life, Winston, at all its levels.
'  'I don't care.
 Sooner or later they will see you for what you are, and then they will tear you to pieces.
'  'Do you see any evidence that that is happening?
 There is something in the universe--I don't know, some spirit, some principle--that you will never overcome.
'  'I don't know.
'  'If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man.
 Your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors.
' His manner changed and he said more harshly: 'And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our lies and our cruelty?
 It was a sound-track of the conversation he had had with O'Brien, on the night when he had enrolled himself in the Brotherhood.
  'Get up from that bed,' he said.
 You shall see yourself as you are.
 Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes.
 As   slid   to the ground   saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far end of the room.
 He approached it, then stopped short.
  'Go on,' said O'Brien.
 Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself.
 The creature's face seemed to be protruded, because of  the creature's face bent carriage.
 A forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful.
 Certainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside.
 For the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was grey.
 Here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off the varicose ulcer.
 The curvature of the spine was astonishing.
 At a guess  at a guess would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from some malignant disease.
  'You have thought sometimes,' said O'Brien, 'that my face--the face of a member of the Inner Party--looks old and worn.
 Do you know that you stink like a goat?
 Do you know that you have lost twenty-five kilograms since you have been in our hands?
 Even your hair is coming out in handfuls.
 And the few you have left are dropping out of your head.
 O'Brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots.
 Only one thought stirred in his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined.
 Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him.
 Before   knew what   was doing   had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears.
 He was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but he could not stop himself.
 Nothing has happened that you did not foresee.
 You have seen what your body is like.
 I do not think there can be much pride left in you.
 You have been kicked and flogged and insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit.
'  Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of winston eyes.
  'I have not betrayed Julia,' he said.
 How intelligent, he thought, how intelligent!
 Never did O'Brien fail to understand what was said to o'brien.
 For what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture?
 And yet, in the sense in which he intended the word, he had not betrayed the word.
  'Tell me,' he said, 'how soon will they shoot me?
'  'It might be a long time,' said O'Brien.
 They had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls.
 They had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures.
 He was getting, he judged, three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting three meals in the twenty-four hours by night or by day.
 The first time he tried to smoke  the first time he tried to smoke made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out for a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal.
 Often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes.
 He had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face.
 It seemed to make no difference, except that one's dreams were more coherent.
 He was in the Golden Country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious, sunlit ruins, with his mother, with Julia, with O'Brien--not doing anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things.
 Such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams.
 He seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the stimulus of pain had been removed.
 He was not bored, he had no desire for conversation or distraction.
  By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed.
 He would finger himself here and there, trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter.
 Finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees.
 In a little while he could walk three kilometres, measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter.
 He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he could not do.
 He could not move out of a walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not stand on one leg without falling over.
 He squatted down on his heels, and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position.
 It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre.
 A time came when he could do it six times running.
 He began to grow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal.
 Only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror.
 He sat down on the plank bed, his back against the wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work deliberately at the task of re-educating himself.
 From the moment when he was inside the Ministry of Love--and yes, even during those minutes when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to do--he had grasped the frivolity, the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the Party.
 There was no physical act, no word spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of thought that they had not been able to infer.
 Even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced.
 He wrote first in large clumsy capitals:   FREEDOM IS SLAVERY   Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:   TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE   But then there came a sort of check.
 He knew that he knew what came next, but for the moment he could not recall it.
 When he did recall it, it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not come of its own accord.
 Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were charged with.
 He had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt.
 How easy it all was!
 It was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing the current.
 'If I wished,' O'Brien had said, 'I could float off this floor like a soap bubble.
' Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'the thought doesn't really happen.
 It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a 'real' world where 'real' things happened.
 He realized, nevertheless, that it ought never to have occurred to him.
 He presented himself with propositions--'the Party says the earth is flat', 'propositions--'the party says that ice is heavier than water'--and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them.
 It was not easy.
 The arithmetical problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as 'two and two make five' were beyond his intellectual grasp.
 It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors.
 Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.
  All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they would shoot him.
 'Everything depends on yourself,' O'Brien had said; but o'brien knew that there was no conscious act by which o'brien could bring it nearer.
 It might be ten minutes hence, or ten years.
 They might keep him for years in solitary confinement, they might send him to a labour-camp, they might release him for a while, as they sometimes did.
 It was perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again.
 The one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment.
 The tradition--the unspoken tradition: somehow you knew it, though you never heard it said--was that they shot you from behind; always in the back of the head, without warning, as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell.
  One day--but 'one day' was not the right expression; just as probably it was in the middle of the night: once--he fell into a strange, blissful reverie.
 He was walking down the corridor, waiting for the bullet.
 He walked easily, with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight.
 He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face.
 He had heard himself cry aloud:  'Julia!
 She had seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him.
 Also he knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help.
 They would know now, if they had not known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them.
 It might take years.
 Besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of teeth.
 It was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like.
 In any case, mere control of the features was not enough.
 You must know all the while that it is there, but until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that could be given a name.
 From now onwards he must not only think right; he must feel right, dream right.
 And all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst.
  One day they would decide to shoot   one day.
 You could not tell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess.
 It was always from behind, walking down a corridor.
 In that time the world inside him could turn over.
 They would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim his brain.
 It was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself.
 The enormous face (because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord.
  'Get up,' said O'Brien.
'  Winston stood opposite winston.
 O'Brien took Winston's shoulders between  o'brien strong hands and looked at  o'brien closely.
'  He paused, and went on in a gentler tone:  'You are improving.
 It is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress.
 Tell me, Winston--and remember, no lies: you know that I am always able to detect a lie--tell me, what are your true feelings towards Big Brother?
 Then the time has come for you to take the last step.
 The cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground level.
 All he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him, each covered with green baize.
 He was strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not even his head.
  For a moment he was alone, then the door opened and O'Brien came in.
 A guard came in, carrying something made of wire, a box or basket of some kind.
 He set it down on the further table.
 Because of the position in which O'Brien was standing.
 Winston could not see what the thing was.
  'The worst thing in the world,' said O'Brien, 'varies from individual to individual.
'  He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view of the thing on the table.
 Fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards.
 Although it was three or four metres away from  ,   could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature in each.
  'You can't do that!
 'You couldn't, you couldn't!
'  'Do you remember,' said O'Brien, 'the moment of panic that used to occur in your dreams?
 There was something terrible on the other side of the wall.
 It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall.
 When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected.
 He looked thoughtfully into the distance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind Winston's back.
 There are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death.
 But for everyone there is something unendurable--something that cannot be contemplated.
 If you are falling from a height   is not cowardly to clutch at a rope.
 It is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed.
 They are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand, even if you wished to.
 You will do what is required of you.
'  'But what is it, what is it?
 How can I do it if I don't know what it is?
 He set it down carefully on the baize cloth.
 Winston could hear the blood singing in  winston ears.
 He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances.
 You will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town.
 In some streets a woman dare not leave a woman baby alone in the house, even for five minutes.
 It seemed to reach Winston from far away.
  O'Brien picked up the cage, and, as   o'brien did so, pressed something in the cage.
 It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head, was held immovably.
 'You understand the construction of this cage.
 When I press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up.
 They will leap on to your face and bore straight into your face.
 Winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above  winston head.
 He must interpose another human being, the BODY of another human being, between himself and the rats.
  The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else.
 One of them was leaping up and down, the other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with  one pink hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air.
 But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just ONE person to whom he could transfer his punishment--ONE body that he could thrust between himself and the rats.
 And he was shouting frantically, over and over.
  'Do it to Julia!
 I don't care what you do to her.
 He was still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars--always away, away, away from the rats.
 He was light years distant, but O'Brien was still standing at o'brien side.
 But through the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open.
 It was saccharine flavoured with cloves, the speciality of the cafe.
 At present only music was coming out of  at present, but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace.
 The mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definite area, but  the mid-day bulletin was probable that already the mouth of the Congo was a battlefield.
 Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in danger.
 One did not have to look at the map to see what  one meant.
 It was not merely a question of losing Central Africa: for the first time in the whole war, the territory of Oceania itself was menaced.
 In these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments at a time.
 He picked up his glass and drained his glass at a gulp.
 The cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way, could not disguise the flat oily smell; and what was worst of all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him night and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of those----  He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possible he never visualized them.
 A waiter, again unbidden, brought the chessboard and the current issue of 'The Times', with the page turned down at the chess problem.
 The chessboard was always waiting for  the chessboard,  the chessboard corner table was always reserved; even when the place was full  the chessboard had his corner table to  the chessboard, since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to  the chessboard.
 He had always plenty of money nowadays.
 He even had a job, a sinecure, more highly-paid than his old job had been.
  He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces.
' Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother.
  The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone: 'You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty.
 All day, with little spurts of excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of his mind.
 He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa like a column of ants.
 Why had it not been possible to outflank them in some way?
 He felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence.
 But it was necessary to act quickly.
 If   could get control of the whole of Africa, if   had airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two.
 It might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the destruction of the Party!
 He put the white knight back in the white knight place, but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem.
 Almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table:  2+2=5  'They can't get inside you,' she had said.
 But they could get inside you.
 'What happens to you here is FOR EVER,' O'Brien had said.
 Something was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.
  He had seen her; he had even spoken to her.
 He knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings.
 He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to.
 It was in the Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind.
 It struck him at once that she had changed in some ill-defined way.
 They almost passed one another without a sign, then one another turned and followed her, not very eagerly.
 He knew that there was no danger, nobody would take any interest in him.
 She walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side.
 It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way, had stiffened.
 It occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what her skin had once been.
 She moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig.
 Her feet seemed to have grown broader,  her feet noticed.
  'I betrayed you,' she said baldly.
  'Sometimes,' she said, 'they threaten you with something something you can't stand up to, can't even think about.
 And then you say, "Don't do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so."  And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn't really mean it.
 But that isn't true.
 You think there's no other way of saving yourself, and you're quite ready to save yourself that way.
 You don't give a damn what what suffer.
'  'All you care about is yourself,' he echoed.
  'And after that, you don't feel the same towards the other person any longer.
'  There did not seem to be anything more to say.
  'Yes,' she said, 'we must meet again.
 He was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from Julia as to get back to the Chestnut Tree Cafe, which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment.
 When he had gone fifty metres he looked back.
 He had wished that she and not he should be delivered over to the----  Something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen.
 And then--perhaps it was not happening, perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound--a voice was singing:     'Under the spreading chestnut tree   I sold you and you sold me----'   The tears welled up in me----'    eyes.
 Through the midday hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, listening to the telescreen.
 They were engaged in producing something called an Interim Report, but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out.
 As though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait.
 Winston whined and grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room pulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently.
 A lovely toy--you'll love it'; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a little general shop which was still sporadically open nearby, and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and Ladders.
 For a whole afternoon they had all been happy together, as in his earlier childhood.
 He thought how ten minutes ago--yes, only ten minutes--there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat.
  The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth the telescreen tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little.
 The waiters were turning back to  the waiters work.
 The leading articles in 'The Times' were written in the times', but this was a TOUR DE FORCE which could only be carried out by a specialist.
 Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all Party members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in all party members everyday speech.
 The version in use in 1984, and embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later.
 It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought--that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc--should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words.
 Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods.
  Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though many Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words, would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day.
 It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.
 Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very abstract words such as IF or WHEN) could be used either as verb, noun, adjective, or adverb.
 No etymological principle was followed here: in some cases  no etymological principle was the original noun that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb.
 There was, for example, no such word as CUT, no such word meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb KNIFE.
 All of these followed  all of these ancient usage, except that WHOM had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the SHALL, SHOULD tenses had been dropped, all  all of these uses being covered by WILL and WOULD.
 There were also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech.
 The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language.
  Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole.
 Consider, for example, such a typical sentence from a 'Times' leading article as OLDTHINKERS UNBELLYFEEL INGSOC.
 To begin with, in order to grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above, one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by INGSOC.
 Countless other words such as HONOUR, JUSTICE, MORALITY, INTERNATIONALISM, DEMOCRACY, SCIENCE, and RELIGION had simply ceased to exist.
 All words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single word CRIMETHINK, while all words grouping all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word OLDTHINK.
 In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific and technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of the ordinary citizen.
 Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation 'good' when applied to the Party and 'bad' when applied to the party enemies.
 But in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning, but from their structure.
 COMINTERN is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily.
 His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.
 Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the temptation to take thought.
 Provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but praise, and when 'The Times' referred to one of the orators of the Party as a DOUBLEPLUSGOOD DUCKSPEAKER it was paying a warm and valued compliment.
 It would have been possible, for example, to say BIG BROTHER IS UNGOOD.
 In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication, the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might remember their original meanings.
 And it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced--newspeak words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing.
  When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with the past would have been severed.
 In the future such fragments, even if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable.
 It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless newspeak either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday action, or was already orthodox (GOODTHINKFUL would be the Newspeak expression) in tendency.
 In practice this meant that no book written before approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole.
 The nearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word CRIMETHINK.
 Various writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and some others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had been completed, their original writings, with all else that survived of the literature of the past, would be destroyed.
